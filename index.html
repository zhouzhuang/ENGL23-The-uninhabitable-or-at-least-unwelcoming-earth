    In all honesty, I thought this article would be like every other article addressing climate change that I had read before. I know that the Earth is warming up. I know that the rate at which it warms up is accelerating, and I know that if action isn't taken now, the future of this planet and its inhabitants won't look too bright. I thought that this article would just be a redundant embellishment of these three points. What I came to realize after getting only two and a half paragraphs deep into "The Uninhabitable Earth" was how incredibly pretentious my attitude towards the subject had been. There was so much more to learn. Rather than give a simple breakdown of the statistics, David Wallace-Wells challenges his readers to drop the past and present and instead project their thoughts into the future. He makes us realize that many parts of the world such as Bangladesh have next to no hope in surviving our current rate of climate change. In addition, Wallace-Wells firmly grounds his readers into the hard reality that we face: the world is on track to surpass the goals set by the Paris Agreement. 
<br><br>
In response to the alarmist attitude that Wallace takes on the subject matter, I believe that this type of approach is completely justified. Climate change is an immediate global threat and should be treated as such. I see the categorization of alarmist activism as a form of procrastination. Many people don't want to accept our harsh reality as such and push away or even ignore the truths that they don't want to accept. If anything, Wallace's alarmist portrayal of the facts at hand give us a more helpful push into the right direction. If our problems are solved now rather than later,  less people will have to suffer the direct consequences of our actions.

I completely agree with your points. I, too, have heard the same three climate change mantras reproduced in similar forms over and over. And, while they are factual and necessary, they're easy to drown out after reading them 3 or 4 times. Wallace-Wells' alarmist approach to the issue of the climate crisis is, indeed, quite necessary. After hearing the same few arguments over and over, people have become somewhat desensitized to the issues that climate change is currently creating and will soon create. This is dangerous. The eventual tragedies of climate change are only growing closer and we, as humans on Earth, can not afford to dismiss what is happening and what will soon happen. 
<br><br>
The many points that Wallace-Wells brings up are alarming, but they are based in facts and scientific data; therefore, they can not be ignored. Wallace-Wells' article is shocking and scary, but that is because the truth of the state of our Earth is shocking and scary. Calling the article extreme makes it easy for some to dismiss it and continue living in denial, but that is the wrong approach. Readers of this article must use the alarming statistics and facts to motivate themselves to seek change. Climate change will soon affect so many aspects of life -- the economy, the return of ancient diseases and more -- that people need to be shocked into seeing the truth. 
<br><Br>
The basic, lighthearted approach to climate change texts is no longer enough to create change. We are operating on a rapidly shrinking timeline and we need to try a harsher approach to inspire change.
<br><hr>
I completely agree; I also believe that Wallace’s approach in this article is justified and should not be considered an “alarmist.” An alarmist is defined as someone who is exaggerating and causes needless worry or panic among individuals. I strongly argue that David Wallace-Wells, in his article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” is definitely not an alarmist, but rather an individual that is voicing the truth. 
<br><Br>

Before I read the article, I initially thought that it would be one of the typical global warming articles that we see time and time again. I agree with Julia that this is becoming dangerous because people are being desensitized to the issue and not comprehending the detrimental impact of global warming that is growing every single day. 
<br><Br>
Wallace’s approach here, however, is definitely serious and intimidating. For example, in the “Heat Death” section, Wallace points out that since 1980, the planet has “experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat.” He then mentions the Paris Agreement, and states that even if we meet the goal of the Agreement, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to inhabitable, which is obviously a scary prospect. 
<br><Br>
Out of all the sections, Section VIII: Poisoned Oceans stood out to me the most. Wallace mentions how we could potentially see at least “four feet of sea-level rise and possibility ten by the end of the century.” He elaborates that this would cause drowning of homelands and ocean acidification, which then would fry our fish population directly, completely destroying the ocean ecosystem and its marine populations as well.
<br><Br>
Overall, I believe that Wallace’s approach was scary and intimidating, but absolutely necessary. He is definitely not being an alarmist since he is actually revealing the horrible truth of the state of our planet, and our time to act is now.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you! Many accuse Wallace-Wells of being too much of an alarmist and that he is simply trying to scare his audience into action. I do see where those people's sentiments are coming from because this article may be exaggerated in a certain aspect. However, this is not to discredit or invalidate Wallace-Wells's points made in this article because much of what he had illustrated in the article is very much true and based upon scientific facts and research evidence. Therefore, he would not be an alarmist because he is only stating the scientific facts and raising public awareness on climate change. Moreover, it is even necessary to be a so-called alarmist in this situation because of how urgent, dire, and critical the issue of climate change has progressed that appalling destruction of the planets and all of its inhabitants including humans ourselves would be unavoidable if no remedial actions are implemented and anthropogenic pollution and emission of greenhouse gases continue to destroy the planet and worsen its conditions.


<br><hr>
I also agree with the fact that Wallace’s urgent perspective in informing the audience about the dangers of the environment is crucial. When I read this article, I primarily felt that he took an alarmist perspective at first which later transitions into being supported by factual evidence. The line between exaggeration versus the truth definitely became clearer although it was partially Wallace’s phrasing which was a bit harshly realistic. For instance in section VIII. Poisoned Oceans, Wallace states “That the sea will become a killer is a given” which he factually supports with “At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today… At present, more than a third of the world’s carbon is sucked up by the oceans”. Wallace definitely informs us of his future predictions through pressing issues that the environment is currently undergoing. I additionally thought that his stance on climate change was greatly supported through logical and statistical reasoning which further convinced me how important being environmentally aware is.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. Before reading this article I was also slightly desensitized to the issue, expecting to read another “typical addressing climate change” article. I liked how Wallace-Wells challenges his readers to see the future. I do agree that Wallace-Wells has an alarmist attitude and believe that this is needed to really emphasize the current issue. 
<br><br>
I agree that it is easy to dismiss Wallace-Wells points but these days people need the harsh reality to be shocked enough to actually make a change. I do however, feel that there are certain parts in his article that may be somewhat exaggerated. Thankfully his factual evidence offsets his exaggeration. 
<br><br>

One of the harsh realities that Wallace-Wells shared that made me extremely concerned was section VIII. The thought of how quickly the ocean is becoming poisoned is scary to me. I agree that we must solve our problems now, before it is too late to fix our ocean.

<br><hr>
I had the same attitude towards the topic and also believed that I would just be reading repetitive points of information. 
<br><br>
A big part of this article that made it intriguing was like you  mentioned, Wells challenging us to project our thoughts into the future. I also found that his alarmist attitude was completely justified. I think bringing about alarming information is what draws in awareness and is needed for such issues like climate change. People do push away and ignore the truth and as he said, its mostly fear that leads to denial. His facts, as you mentioned, will hopefully guide many of us in the right direction.
<br><Hr>

As someone who is fairly unfamiliar to all the detailed facts and statistics of this topic it was a very powerful introduction to have. I feel like the intense, passionate way he wrote about the matter made me feel as though I myself was being pulled into one of the tornadoes he was talking about, and the severity of the issue dawned on me. By giving so many vivid examples from a variety of aspects of life, like the economy, oceans, food, war, air quality, and overall safety I feel like he was truly able to decipher the severity of this issue and justify his delivery of the material. 
<br><br>

To me this article seemed like something everyone should read, like it should be a standard within the shooting system. While a lot of people especially political leaders blame certain events, such as natural disasters on other issues, this article goes to show how it's all interconnected. Because we know the root of the issue, and we know how we could solve it, there is no reason we shouldn't be. And the fact that we aren't is what is creating this urgency we felt through his text. I feel the same way about the idea of alarmist activism to prevent procrastination of the subject as we have been. It's sad to see that Wallace has to point out the worst outcomes to make people feel something, but if that is the way to bring awareness to the subject I fully support it.
<br><Hr>
I agree with you whole-heartedly. Before I read this article, I thought there was only a set list of problems and consequences having to do with this anthropogenic climate change. It never occurred to me to understand more about this issue. And to be completely honest, I lost hope in humanity to actually care about where they live and that this point-of- no-return was inevitable. I now see where I was wrong in my thinking and, instead, it should have alarmed me even more. With more knowledge, I feel called to action and OBLIGATED (in a good way) to do something or, at least, share with others. Although I was quite depressed as David Wallace-Wells went on about the "heat death, starvation, Zika, and more, he laid it all out, in detail, very well. 
<br><br>
I also agree that this "alarmist attitude" is reasonable. In my opinion, Wells is not trying to frighten people but, rather, wake them up because this could EASILY be our reality. We need articles like this, that grab the people by their shoulders and shake them awake. Specifically, the section that was the most compelling and scared the living soul out of me was about the "Climate Plague". I never thought that I or future family would have to fight off diseases because of these melting ice caps. I didn't even realized that all of this is just a giant snowball effect.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said. I feel like climate change is easy to talk about but actually when you finally face the danger, you would realize how much dangerous it could be and I think it’s far from our imagination. After reading Wallace-Wells’s article, I feel like I have deeper understanding about how’s climate change going on.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with the points your comment made. One of the things I liked most about Wallace-Well's "The Uninhabitable Earth" was how direct he was about the harsh realities of the climate crisis. His article is incredibly thought-provoking and I think that the structure and wording of the article is especially helpful for people who don't know a lot of in-depth detail about the climate crisis; Wallace makes it so it's easy to read and understand while still keeping an urgent tone all throughout. Even though I had previous knowledge about a handful of the things he mentioned (like an increase in violence/wars and toxic air pollution) I still felt a large sense of anxiousness after reading the article. It's easy to understand why someone else reading the article would be pushed to the point of despair and inaction. However, we're at a point in time where we can't keep trying to undermine the sheer multitude of impacts the climate crisis will impose in years to come. I would argue that much of the inaction on combatting the issue stems from the way scientists and the media communicate information about the climate crisis to the general public. Again though, we can't afford to continue undermining its significance. As I mentioned, I felt a lot of anxiety after reading the article, but I also felt pushed to take action and want to learn more. I really don't think that Wallace risks alienating any readers--his directness is the most compelling point of the article. While it may create feelings of anxiousness and despair within the reader, it does so in a way that is informing them of the very real impacts of the climate crisis; it will probably leave them with more knowledge and desire to do something to ensure that those impacts don't occur.
<br><hr>
I too had lost some of my urgency in regards to climate change. And again, like you, reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by Wallace-Wells certainly jarred me from my complacency. I found it helpful that Wallace-Wells broke the article down into different sections to highlight the full effects climate change would have on all aspects of life. The format made it easy to follow and focus on each effect while emphasizing how nothing will remain untouched if temperatures continue to increase.
 <br><br>
I also agree with your comment that taking an alarmist view is sometimes necessary/justifiable. Many sources try to avoid taking an alarmist view because they want to appeal to a larger audience and they believe alarmism will turn people away. However, in doing this these authors sometimes lose the urgency needed when speaking of climate change. Wallace-Well’s article is successful because it is able to create a feeling of urgency through facts, showing both how climate change has already affected our planet and how it is likely to make it unlivable in the future.

<br><hr>
I also thought I was well informed on things regarding climate change but just the beginning of "The Uninhabitable Earth" surprised me by showing major consequences that can happen in the near future. With statistics about the carbon trapped under the ice in the poles and the potentness of it as a greenhouse gas as well as showing that locations such as Bangladesh and Miami will be destroyed by climate change, Wallace -Wells goes further than only providing data  by showing specific consequences that are likely to happen. I would categorize Wallace-Wells as having an alarmist approach but I think that dealing with this problem as soon as possible is the best way especially when you consider the magnitude of it.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment particularly your initial feelings and ideas about the climate crisis. I also understood (to a a degree) that global warming was having severe affects in our environment and that these changes would only become worse if we didn't make a large impact now. However, it was not something that I constantly thought about or even made me want to change the way I live now. David Wallace-Wells uses a very strong tone and like you mentioned, an alarmist approach to this issue. This helps us understand how serious this all really is and how we will see the climate crisis unravel before our eyes sooner than later. While I think that this article would not be the best for people who already don't believe in climate change, it would simply be another excuse to not understand the facts because Wallace supports all his ideas with evidence. There are harsh realities that we need to accept in order to change, because like mentioned fear leads to denial and there is no time to waste.
<br><hr>
I agree that Wallace-Wells' approach to climate change in this article is particularly effective due to how different it is from other sources on the topic. I can see why people call him an alarmist because he focuses on the worst case scenario; however, he is not exaggerating the effects of climate change, but rather conveying just how extreme they could be. I found this article different because it really highlights how climate change can be detrimental to humans, while a lot of the time, it seems as though humans will be able to rely on technology to save them. He writes about how the rises in temperatures will prevent Muslims from completing their pilgrimage and directly addresses that places in our own country, like New York City, are at risk of becoming hot enough to kill people in their sleep.
 <br><br>

Wallace-Wells introduces effects of climate change that I had never even considered before. He writes that even with air conditioning, the crime rate rises in the summer and includes the link between climate and war in Syria. I did not realize how far the effects of climate change could extend in our daily lives. Each topic in the article has ideas that I have not read before and methodically map out how each area of our life can be affected: the food shortages, the rise in disease, the economic effects, etc. I knew that ocean acidification killed coral, but Wallace-Wells conveys that the ocean can eventually create such a poisonous atmosphere that it will poison land, too.
 <br><br>

I also thought the article was incredibly interesting, even for those not well versed in climate change. The idea that there is a "Great Filter" that causes "alien" civilizations to die out before we find each other is particularly though-provoking. It is a scary thought that we are doomed to destroy our planet, but Wallace-Wells also follows this up by saying that the scientists he talks to tend to have hope that humans will be able to change before this happens.

My preconceived notions regarding the David Wallace article were it was structured similar to most Climate change orientated media. 
 <br><br>

He makes us realize that many parts of the world such as Bangladesh or Miami have slim survival hope, if any. The world is on track to surpass the goals set by the Paris Agreement. The return of diseases our bodies will not understand how to approach, and poisoned ocean mean 97% of existing life forms will perish. In the article “In Alaska researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million.” Is that not alarming enough? 1.8 trillion tons of carbon found in the Arctic permafrost alone. Carbon may evaporate into methane. This could potentially lead to acid rain. Another pressing issue is the current Australian bush fire. The Australian bushfire season is of notable intensity this year as the severe fire is terminating lives of millions of koala. Many of the example of the anthropogenic induced extinction are among the most pressing issues. 
<br><hr>
Skimming the replies to this comment, I've seen that most people agree with the idea that "the alarmist attitude that Wallace takes [...] is completely justified". Seeing as how this is a very nuanced issue, I would like to offer a few counterpoints to this claim to sort of balance out the discussion. First of all, it should be noted that several scientists pushed back on this article, stating that the scenarios put forth went beyond worst case (Scientists challenge magazine story about ‘uninhabitable Earth’). Making the highly specific predictions that the author did, on things that could happen in over a century provided no chance in pattern, is incredibly difficult to do with accuracy. To publish information with such a confident tone that implies a scientific consensus when there is none is border line irresponsible. As Hiltner mentions, Wallace-Wells later published an article entitled "We’re Getting a Clearer Picture of the Climate Future — and It’s Not as Bad as It Once Looked". Secondly, I get what the author is trying to do here. For far too long we have been complacent, and for some his article can be the thing that shakes their complacency. My issue with this is that, while fear is a powerful motivator, it quickly corrupts into despair when no solution is provided. The Uninhabitable Earth lays out all the reasons we have to fear climate change, but does remarkably little in the way of providing concrete solutions. This seems to me to be the equivalent of pulling a fire alarm without having marked any exits or provided any fire extinguishers. Lastly, climate change is an extremely complex issue. In presenting it with little finesse or regard for nuance, Wallace-Wells is just joining the shouting match with climate change deniers. Those three things being said, I think Wallace-Wells got a few things right. More people do need to know there's a fire, we do need to plan for a worse than median scenario, and we cannot just sit back and watch. 
<br><hr>
I second this. David Wallace-Well's approach in "The Uninhabitable Earth" is effective in that it carries out a balance between nourishing readers with facts but also giving readers a little taste of the catastrophic damage that we are inducing on our planet. Unlike other sources concerning the issue of climate change, Wells approaches the issue not by attacking the individual, but, instead, shifts his focus to covering each danger, (or side effect if you will) of climate change on a global scale. Wells covers a wide range of  information to get his idea across; from potential war to economic damage; not only did he reinforce my understanding of aspects that I was already familiar with, but exposed me to topics which I had never even considered to be part of packaged deal which we as humans gifted ourselves. For example, Wells proposed that an never-ending war and rapid economic decline are concerns to be mindful of. While these events carry an ''alarmist'' tone, Wells is sure to include his positive expectation that just as man engineered his way into this massive climate mess, hoping that man will also re-engineer his way out, and reverse the possibilities of full-fledged war and economic depressions. You see, David Wallace-Wells offers an approach like none other that I have read. Essentially, what he is doing is, presenting the reader with the facts and alarming hypothetical situations that have potential to occur if we, as the human race continue in our environmental ignorance. Quite frankly, I suppose that I never really understood the severity of the impact that just a couple degrees in temperature could have such a profound effect, so much so that waling around in the tropics (with such humidity) could leave a person fried within minutes. His examples are alarming and indeed, they are quick to instill fear into the reader but in a sense, I feel that Wells is saying: do what you will with these ideas, its up to humanity as a whole to wake up and respond to this urgent call to action.
<br><hr>
I have had the same attitude towards articles that addresses severe problems and believe that the authors have been overly nervous. But now I really would like to share Wallace's article with some of my friends who are too optimistic and sees authors who address the real problem as alarmist, like I was before. I hope this article could alert more people to seriously face the environmental problems at hand.
<br><hr>
I think we all agree with you that after reading this article, I felt that it was the same exact things that I have been hearing over and over just compiled into one big text. This is OK, as long as we realize it.  David Wallace-Wells' approach to thinking about the future instead of lingering on the past sparks readers to change the future though and I think this is what we really need in this day in age...  I also agree that problems need to be solved NOW rather than later to reduce further suffering.
<br><hr>

After reading the uninhabitable earth (even while reading it), I also felt the same sense of pretentiousness that I feel as if I was raised with. I thought this article was going to be a very alarmist author telling us crazy possibilities that might happen to our planet from climate change. I never fully understood just how bad climate change is and how much it will affect us in the future. It is scary to me that I feel like I was raised in a relatively progressive household trying to do everything we can do to save the planet, and I still have somewhat of a pretentious attitude towards the things I have and the things that we can do or should do to climate change. I am happy that we are watching and reading various assignments and gathering various perspectives on the issue because it not only shows us how disrupt our climate is, but how disrupt the people are in it. This article, along with you, helped me to gain a greater perspective on the issue of climate change as it discusses all the things that are a possibility (and not even a far off possibility) to our Earth and the inhabitants on Earth. 
  <br><br>
Along with you, I believe not only is an alarmist approach justified but I believe it is necessary in this day and age. I think that I didn’t want to accept the reality of where our world is headed, so I went into it with a pretentious attitude, but with an alarmist approach I feel more put in my place.
<br><hr>
I also agree with what X says in his comment. Examples can be accurate and sufficient evidences for us to believe in an argument. The argument that the professor mentions above, such as five largest wild fires in California all happen in this decade, also 5 hurricanes in 6 categories happened in these 4 years lately, Arctic sea ice cover has dropped 13% this decade, rare floods happened, and 100 billion dollar climate disasters doubled this decade, which shows how serious the environment is changing these years, making people realize the level of the disasters and try to save the environment before it’s too late. Many people treat Wallace as an alarmist and argue that he overstates the truth, exaggerates influence from the scientific evidences, but actually that does no harms, since this is exactly the right way for people to treat the environmental issue seriously.
  <br><br>

Back to my country, the air pollution there is really terrible and even within that situation, people neither didn’t realize how serious the pollution is that they still making every student have morning runs in the name of pursuing good health, nor realize that people should start acting now for stoping building more factories or manufacturing more cars. After all, there isn’t an “alarmist” there to warn everyone about it.

<p>
Reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” open the riders eyes to the real affects of climate change. I’m not just told the Earth is going to heat up and the weather is going to get hotter. Real catastrophic events are and will occur during our lifetime or the next. David Wallace-Wells strikes fear into the readers eyes by events that are already occurring in our world today. We should not have the biggest glacier drop into the ocean in the past year or even have fear that the ice containing gas that could possibly destroy our atmosphere could melt within the next 60 years. This article finally shows readers the detrimental affects that climate change has and really makes ourselves want to change our habits in order to try slow down climate change or even reverse it.

<p>
The article really surprised me and gave me a lot to think about. Prior to joining this class and reading this article, I understood that the issue surrounding climate change was something important that needs to be addressed. However, I did not understand just how grave the issue was. Wallace-Wells stance on it is rather alarmist indeed. Everything that he is saying, however, is true and such things such as heat death, economic collapse, poisoned oceans are all possible things that will occur if we do not work to solve this issue and reverse the damage that has already been made. No matter how much people will hate to admit it, after reading this article, people have no choice but to understand just how grave of a danger we are in. Climate change is indeed a global threat and people can no longer ignore this issue. 
<br><br>
In addition, the stats that the professor stated in the video such as "We pumped a record 40.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air and that was just 2019" and "4 of the 5 largest California wildfires in history happened this decade" are completely true and things that we cannot ignore. We are feeling the effects of climate change at this moment and if we do not work to change our stance on the issue collectively, there will no longer be a world for us to live in.

    I honestly felt the same way!  I think the facts that Wallace-Wells used, even if they make this article a bit of a dry read, are so alarming yet based in truth that it serves as a call to action. For example, the quote "Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we’ll lose them within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel within the next decade..." personally hit home in a terrifying way. However, while I feel spurred to action by this, it's worth noting that my motivation is not enough. Though grassroots movements composed of people like myself are alive and well, by the end of my first reading of the article, I felt tired and cynical. If the IPCC could not convince world governments, if rising backlash and public protests could not convince them, then what is this article, though a genuine and factual plea for action, supposed to do?
<br><br>
The professor also mentioned that as an alarmist, Wallace-Wells may be dismissed. Despite acknowledging that possibility, I still appreciate the tone for the reasons Nicole mentioned above. Additionally, it is the only appropriate tone to take when the world is so clearly going to...let's say garbage and nobody is doing anything about it. I was especially alarmed by the sections on Heat Death, Perpetual War, and Unbreathable Air. As I read the annotated version of the article that came out a few days after, I had a better idea going in of the critiques and commentary that people had about The Uninhabitable Earth. The varying sources and the high amount of them also helped his already-compelling case.
<br><br>
Finally, the most alarming stat for me that the professor mentioned that floods that previously had a 1 in 1000 chance of happening are now common. In other words, the chance of such floods has gotten nearly 1000 times worse, much like the climate crisis of the present time.

In the article “The Inhabitable Earth”, it shows many severe consequences caused by climate change which can cause huge destroy on Earth life and even the Earth itself. This book make me eye-opening since i learned many consequences that I’ve never know. Before the reading, i know the climate change would have negative impact but i didn’t know climate change would harm so widely even on every aspect of our life and severe. Like the heat death and climate plagues, these are consequences that i never know and i couldn’t even guess. It’s terrible that a large amount of people can even be killed by heat. We can see how serious the global warming is.
<br><br>
The situation of global warming is too severe to reverse and there will be unpreventable consequences even though we take effective actions successful. Like the article tells us, “most of the scientists assume we’ll lose them within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade.” and even “no plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.” However, if we don’t change how we conduct our live, just like the article tells, “parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.”
<br><br>
There are many terrifying data and comparison in the reading that make me feel pretty worried. Especially when i knew from the reading that we are currently adding carbon into the atmosphere at at least 10times faster rate than the rate at the most notorious mass extinction the Earth has experienced which make 97 per cent of all life on Earth dead. This is worrying.

In David Wallace-wells' article”The Uninhabitable Earth”, he discloses the severeness of a warming future. I thought I have heard enough of consequences of global warming, nothing other than rising sea-level that would sink some places. However, he reveals that climate change can lead to more catastrophic circumstances which seems to me very alarming. In my opinion, such message that simply freaks me, as a typical reader, out is very effective in persuading and promoting climate crisis. It is also extremely effective when persuading people who are undergoing results of climate crisis such as Californian wildfire mentioned in article; it is hard not to believe that climate crisis is in presence and a direct threat.

David Wallace-Wells' "The Uninhabitable Earth" overall rings alarmist. However, no matter how someone tries to bring about attention to the climate crisis, it would be considered alarmist to someone. What Wallace-Wells does is to instill some sort of fear/worry into the reader, which I find justifiable. The article sounded as if its coming from a very frustrated mentality, but it's understandable. We have to make changes as soon as possible before the consequences are irreversible. 

<br><br>

In all honesty, I used to ignore a lot of articles that talked about climate change due to the fact of how alarmist they sounded. It was annoying at some points, so I just simply muted/numbed them. But this article hit differently, maybe because it was part of the class, or maybe because I matured, but either way, it was for the better.

As quoted from the reading: “The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock, and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into.” I understand that all we have done is to keep our planet safe to us, but I carry different opinions with others. I do not think it’s time to start to care about the climate change yet. We must know it and understand it, but we should not get start to worry about it that much. The process of solving the climate change is quite long and not very effective. For example, before 2008, many countries devote to solve global warming issues and there are visible effects made. However, just because of the great recession happened in 2008, all works done are corrupted and the global warming becomes even higher than before. I recommend it’s better for us to develop technology to solve it as the first approach rather than reducing emissions.

Honestly, after reading this article, I would have to say that it was the article that really changed my entire scope of thinking on the climate crisis. Before this article I knew the climate crisis we are currently facing is severe, but it was not so transparent by my basic knowledge of climate change that its effects will be very strategically changing the ways me and my peers operate as human beings and normalize commodities as necessities. Due to this disbelief of mine, while I consider myself much more aware regarding environmental issues than many of my friends, I believe that Wallace’s tactic as an alarmist is very effective in communicating the correct level of urgency and stress every member of a developed nation on this Earth should feel. Although the conceit of this article was very controversial, I believe that the current inaction of the majority of our population to actively alter their consumption of fossil fuels and live a more sustainable lifestyle justifies the need for articles such as “The Uninhabitable Earth” which very realistically outlines the harsh consequences of living life with a consumer mentality, living far beyond the means necessary for a successful life, while poor and underdeveloped countries face the worst environmental disasters from changes in the environment spurred by global warming from highly developed and industrialized countries. Since nearly seventy-five percent of all carbon emissions in the atmosphere were put there in the last 50 to 60 years, I don’t believe that enough members of our population truly realize how quickly we must normalize sustainable living including switching to all-electric cars, streamlined public transportation, and a greener diet in order for places such as Miami and Bangladesh to be spared and for animals in the Arctic to not go extinct. This switch includes giving up drive-thru’s, fast-food, beef, the luxury to transport yourself far distances whenever you want, and purchasing countless unnecessary material goods and clothing. I grew up with a mother who I called “frugal” and always asked me if something I asked her for at the store was a “need” or a “want” item, and this is a mindset that a lot more Americans will soon  have to adopt in order to save this lovely home we call Earth.

<p>
It is so true that people are unable to comprehend the scope of the climate crisis. It’s crazy how the world was/is warming a lot faster than scientists thought it would be. When Wallace said “But no matter how well informed you are, you surely aren’t alarmed enough” I think this to be very true. I feel like it doesn’t really hit you until you experience it in some way. It’s astonishing how because of how people who don’t believe in climate change scientists are “cautious in offering speculative warnings”.  Climate change denial is being sparked by the delay in the effects which I guess seems a little reasonable. It was definitely shocking to read that mass extinctions have been caused by climate change which is made possible by greenhouse gases. Even if we start acting now the effects of the past will still affect us in the future.



</p><hr>


<p>
From this article”The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-wells, he explains lots of examples of climate changes and consequences what will destroy our environment, so that is the reason why we should be the alarmist to make actions, giving movement to deal with the climate crisis. I can really know why this generation doesn’t care about climate change, because people always to try some unknown circumstance, especially it is something bad for our future. So that’s why so many business people refuse the knowledge of David Wallace-Wells.
<br><br>
In the end, I think after reading David Wallace-Wells’ article , we should focus on how to protect the environment, for our lives.




</p><hr>


<p>
After reading "Uninhabitable Earth", I was surprised that there are still a lot of people doubt on global warming. They consider the global warming is just a joke and totally ignore what is happening in the world. Although the author use alarmist attitude on describing the climate changing, it is a good way to make people take actions immediately. If we could decide to make some differences now, our next generation can suffer less from the climate changing.

The part of "The Uninhabitable Earth" that stuck with me the most was when Wallace-Wells discussed mass extinctions. He said, "The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock, and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into.” This kind of changed the way I have been thinking about climate change recently. I think that most people can, at least to some extent, understand the fact of their own mortality. We know that eventually we will die, and because of this, the distant threat of human extinction due to climate change is doesn't affect a lot of people. But when phrased like this - in terms of "slate-wiping" the evolutionary record, it strikes a different chord. We are no longer talking about the destruction of individual lives, but the entire progress and evolution of all creatures on the planet. I think that due to our mortality, the concepts of legacy and evolution and history are important to humans. We want to feel like we have made an impact, that our lives somehow contributed to the larger story. Wallace-Wells effectively targets this desire, showing us that climate change does so much more that simply cause an already-inevitable death. It cuts our species'-and so many other species'- time short on this planet. When looking at it this way, it becomes so evident how much we are messing with nature and natural processes.

<p>
A balanced interpretation of Wallace-Wells article would be one that considers both the factual argument he is making regarding the all-encompassing nature of climate change as well as the more emotional one: that through showing the detrimental effects climate change can have on our lives and the lives of others, maybe we will be in some way compelled to act upon that information. But, in my opinion, that comes at a cost. In Wallace-Wells own words, “aversion arising from fear is a form of denial”, and the principle emotion generated from reading the authors words is fear: fear for my life, my childrens lives, fear of the future. Does that fear compel me to act? No. It compels me to hide in denial. What I think Wallace-Wells is really doing is making an argument about how the more we are informed about climate change, the harder it is to comprehend and therefore act on it that information. 
<br><br>
This interpretation can also of course be counterbalanced by the idea that alarmism--or the simple act of freaking people out about climate change--is incredibly effective when it comes to promoting action in favor of pro-climate policy. Considering how much misinformation there is regarding the climate change debate, it is notable that bringing up impact-oriented approaches to information can be quite effective.

In this article, the author argues that the outcome of climate change. The average temperature changes every year, but people did not realize the importance of those changes. From studies, it seems that there will be 1.5-degree inevitable temperature rises, and those changes will cause significant global destroy. In the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, the author, David Wallace wells showed his worries about continuously increasing temperature problems on his book. Wallace focuses on the problems that cause by the two to four degrees temperature changes. And he believes that if people could take action, those problems are avoidable. There are some records to show that our planet is on changing. Ken lists 7 proofs, first of all, is that the past five years was the hottest ever recorded on the earth. Second, the largest wildfires happened in California. Third, more hurricanes happened in the Atlantic region; Forth, ice cover on the Arctic sea is disappearing at the moment. The fifth, floods happened more and more frequently. Sixth, climate change costs become much higher than before. And the last one is that the emission of CO2 had significantly increased. In my opinion, although we cannot see what will happen in the future, we could make some predictions that the continuously increasing of temperature will bring a lot of problems to the earth.

Before reading this article, I thought that I was pretty well aware and well informed of everything pertaining to climate change and what the consequences would be if humans don't do anything to stop it.  Now I know that I was so naive to think that.  There are so many more things that I had never even thought about, and the things that I did know are so much worse than I thought.  I had no idea that it was even possible for humans to be "cooked" by just stepping outside, yet that will be the fate of a good quarter of the population; everyone who lives on or near the equator.  This particular fact hit extra hard for me because I am Brazilian and all of my family lives in Brazil, which means that they will be directly affected by this.  Another thing I had never even begun to consider was the possibility of ancient diseases being trapped in the ice, yet that has already begun happening in the world, with the deer that was trapped in the permafrost.  I knew that if climate change was allowed to keep moving forward, much of the world would become uninhabited, but I didn't realize that it could become a reality so soon.  It blew my mind to think that only a few more degrees of warming means that almost all of the areas where crops are now grown could become an inhospitable desert, yet that seems to already be happening.  It scares me to think that a lot of these seemingly apocalyptic scenes could become a reality in my lifetime, yet we are already seeing more intense weather and extreme fires and devastation, and most of the world seems to be in denial of how serious these threats really are.  Wallace-wells stated in his article that if it got warmer, the Amazon would be at risk for a devastating fire, and then just a few weeks ago that became a reality, yet it didn't seem to matter to most people, as it blew up for a few days in the news then went back to normal celebrity coverage.  It was also super startingly to find out how bad the smog problem already is in much of the world; I had no idea that the air in large parts of China is deadly to breathe.  I can't imagine trying to live in a place where just stepping outside means death.  I am a surfer and most of my life revolves around the ocean and water, so learning that a large part of the Gulf of Mexico is already a dead zone and how soon much more of the ocean will turn into these zones makes me incredibly sad, and honestly a little hopeless.  I know that there is much of the world that is working on solutions for climate change, but it seems to me that if the world doesn't unite as one and work together to save our planet then the future is bleak for planet Earth.

<br><br>

I think that some of the points made in the article were a little exaggerated, yet the way that Wallace-wells portrayed the fate of our planet as something out of a horror movie does a good job in throwing the ugly truth in our face and educating the general public on the horrors that can soon become a reality if nothing is done to change.

After reading the article "Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I was informed that there are many different possible consequences caused by climate change if we do not take action immediately, including poisoned oceans, economic collapse, and unbreathable air, and the most compelling part of Wallace's article I think may be the part of losing food. As Well says we might have a population of 10 billion by 2050 which will only cause a greater demand of food. Since growing temperatures decrease crop yields and droughts occur more frequently, we will not be able to feed everyone. When Well is saying that about " 800 million globally" will experience undernourishment, which is absolutely alarming, I was quite shocked knowing that lots of people will be without food and there will probably be wars as countries fight for more land for crops. In addition, I had never thought of and was surprised that global warming could relate to diseases and plagues around the world before. After reading the article, I realized that in the Arctic Ice there are diseases that are trapped and could be released into the world with no known cure if the ice caps in Antarctica continue to melt which could emerge as prehistoric plagues.
<br><br>

Wallace starts the writing off with a sentence letting his readers know that he won’t be taking care of their feelings: “It is, I promise, worse than you think.”  I think it is great for readers since too many people today are still hesitant to consider this topic seriously or take actions to help the climate crisis because they are not fully aware of the current situation about what we are going through right now. But with Well’s article, in which every claim he makes is backed up by numerous facts, I believe there will be more people paying their attentions on this topic and actually do something, just like me.

Before reading the article, I thought it would just be another “climate change cliche”. But I was shocked after reading it and watching this video. Even though we heard about climate change every single day, most of us have never done anything to help slow it down. In the article, there are several main points the author made about the consequences of climate change, and each of them is terrifying, especially the forth one, the climate plagues. 
<br><br>
Human beings are emitting far more greenhouse gases than the earth could bear. And even though the US has far less people than China does, its greenhouse gases emissions are in the second place of world, following China. And even though there is the Paris Agreement, there’s no enforcement. So I think people all around the world, especially developed countries should really act on climate change and save human beings from extinction decades later.

Professor Hitner's familiarity with specific environmental points of discussion and policymaking at the international level is outstanding and adds to the credibility of his approach to the Climate crisis through the lens of the humanities. It is an ambitious yet plausible goal to have nations , (196) committed ones to not only agree to mitigate the global temperature rise below 2 degrees celsius but  to also accomplish it. 5 years ago 196 nations committed to it at the 21st annual session of (C.O.P. 21) --> the Paris Agreement. However, although these nations agreed to commit  to such goal it has not yet come to fruition due to the greed and ego of certain actors in the international landscape. 

<br><br>

Thus, keeping that in mind David Wallace-Well's think piece is of upmost importance to "startle us into action".  It is of my opinion that Wallace-Well's assessment that rise of sea-levels are but the "surface worries" of the many, interconnected impending catastrophes is definitely spot on. The North Pole is melting at a drastic rate, the Permafrost which encased Norway's Sualbard seed vault (global food bank) known as "Doomsday" is depleting and appeared to be flooded in less than 10 years after it was constructed.  Additionally, the in depth depletion of the Permafrost would be fatal to the atmosphere and habitable conditions of bio everywhere since 1.8 trillion tons of C02 would be released  (could potentially thaw and evaporate as CH4) --> the Albedo effect (less ice = less reflection of the sun's rays & heat thus --> much more absorbed heat into the globe). 
<br><br>

In essence what I see all around me from young and old alike particularly the old is as Wallace-Wells explains,  "aversion arising from fear [as] a form of denial". 
<br><br>
Still, I was both awestruck and puzzled by the fact that prior to our present period of mass extinction there had been 5 previous one with 4/5 of them been the direct result of the climate change produced by the mass increase of green house gases ( the only exception been the mass extinction that wiped out the reign of the Dinosaurs Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction). This conjured a simple yet difficult question in my mind: Are we meant to be eradicated in order to cleanse the globe of our filth?
<br><br>

Many of my colleagues and underclassmen alike believe Wallace-Wells to be an "alarmist" but I differ completely & fundamentally. We are all complicit in "ignorance is bliss" mentality. We need this to be in our faces now, we have been selfish long enough.

The passage reveals some facts about climate change which we rarely read from other sources. Usually, we know that global warming will incur sea level rising and flooding in some coastal cities. However, flooding is not the whole image of climate change. The increasing temperature will induce dehydration in some place. Also, there are different diseases trapped in ice. If the temperature is rising constantly, the diseases will kill lots of people. Air becomes unbreathable too. The air pollution causes that people cannot go out. Increasing fraction of carbon dioxide affects the cognitive ability of people. According the passage, we are facing a large danger because of climate change. Although there have different organizations and agreements to protect our fragile environment, it is late. So we must try our best to do environmental friendly actions, because at the same time of protecting the environment, we are protecting ourselves too. The severe conditions of the environment are warning us!

In Wallace-Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", portrays a portion of the serious outcomes that might result from environmental change if no move is made. Not at all like how an unnatural weather change is normally depicted in governmental issues and the media, Wallace-Wells' doesn't gloss over the seriousness of the circumstance. While this methodology may appear fearful to a few, I accept that it is essential so as to move any genuine change. Wallace-Wells' uses actualities and clear proof to help his cases, which is a viable method to persuade perusers that what he is stating is legitimate and that environmental change can never again be disregarded.
<br><br>

Be that as it may, I for one don't imagine that a fearful approach is the main methodology fundamental in invigorating activity. Indeed, I think the motivation behind why a larger part of individuals choose to disregard environmental change, is on the grounds that no one needs to manage and attempt to comprehend critical, upsetting and the mind boggling material that articles like "The Uninhabitable Earth" give. I think this is only a consequence of an inborn quality people have that essentially characterizes their failure to comprehend enduring in a profitable manner. No one prefers being determined what to do, not to mention shaken deeply about an up and coming end of the world. Truly, this unquestionably shows a shortcoming in the human association with environmental change, yet in any case it's something that I think ought to be taken in thought while talking about environmental change.
<br><br>

Ultimately, the end insights and certainties toward the finish of this video truly put the impacts of environmental change on the climate into point of view. It is an overwhelming fac that so much has occurred over the previous decade. This raises the question to me that if halting or hindering environmental change is in any event, something that is conceivable, or on the off chance that it is only a piece of the world's development.

David Wallance-Wells’ is extremely alarming and provokes many emotions. It is straightforward and does not shy away from telling the truth that many of us are afraid to hear. I think the author's unapologetic attitude is very important because it tempts us to question our own knowledge and surrender to the idea of skepticism and denial. While this article is alarming, I believe this alarmist tone is necessary to shake up society. I really identified with the quote “when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer an incredible failure of imagination.” To me this quote reflects how a majority of our society is incapable of imagining what the future will look like. Whether this is due to fear, or simply lack of knowledge, we have grown up in a society that has trained us as little capitalist with an unending desire for consumerism and instant gratification, whether we want to accept this or not, it is the reality we live in. We need to relearn how to use our imagination and dare to take on the climate crisis in order to give it the immediate action it requires. Overall, this article did give me feelings of doom and destruction, however, it also provoked a sense of urgency and inspiration. I know that collectively humans have caused the crisis we are in today, but I also know that we are living in a time period that is doing more to bring awareness and bring action to stop climate change.

I was genuinely surprised with the article "The Inhabitable Earth." I have had some knowledge in the past of climate change and what ha been leading up to our current situation. I learned about the rising global temperatures and how those temperatures have been causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt. I knew that the sea levels were rising and that the rainforests and trees have been significantly reduced. I believed I knew a fair amount about climate change, yet I never took any extra effort to research and invest my time and energy in the matter. 
<br><br>
After reading this article, I realized that I in fact was not as knowledgeable as I once believed I was. The article does not linger on simple facts and spit out common knowledge. In fact the article addresses the fact that this situation is awful and not looking very good for anyone. I felt sad and hopeless hearing about places that wont survive soon if immediate drastic change comes about. So many people want to push away the facts and avoid the reality that this is a  true honest problem and one the sucks. If change isn't made and soon, we wont be looking very good in the near future.

There is a fine line between pushing readers to act against climate change and making readers feel absolutely hopeless about the future, if there is even one to come. "The Inhabitable Earth" by Wallace-Wells arguably rests on the latter spectrum of this fine line. Although he presents a few optimistic views of some climate scientists, such as Jim Hansen, most of his article suggests to a bleak, unsavable future. As an alarmist, Walace-Wells has definitely succeeded in alarming his readers. However, I question the role of such an alarmist. The climate crisis is real and is now, but by being such an aggressive and pessimistic alarmist, Wallace-Wells risks scaring away a large amount of possible readers. Like he said in this article, "aversion arising from fear is a form of denial, too". After reading "The Inhabitable Earth", I was left feeling petrified and hopeless, petrified because suddenly all the apocalyptic movies I've watch seemed to no longer be just fiction and hopeless because I don't even know where to start in stopping this inevitability from happening.  If I could give Wallace-Wells some advice, I would suggest that he writes more about how we can mitigate pollution or other anthropogenic factors contributing to the climate crisis. By doing this, he can not only be an alarmist, but also an educator who will give directions to how everyone can pitch in and hopefully prevent imminent climate disasters.

After reading “The inhabitable earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I was totally shocked. The author broke down the climate crisis we are facing into several parts like “Doomsday,” “Heat death”, “The end of food” and etc. Our interpretation of the threatening climate crisis is too shallow that we simply define global warming as the sea level’ s rising which is not the full case.Because people are releasing too much carbon dioxide that reach the limit of the earth, the world will likely become inhospitable at the end of this century. 
<br><br>
Human beings are pursuing their developing goals with the expense of our living environment: The melting of Norway’s Svalbard see vault which Peter Brannen describes as “the end of the world”; the rising temperature that will cause countless deaths around the world especially the tropical areas; less food to support but more people to feed as the world’s population is growing at an accelerating rate so may undernourished people will be killed; The unbreathable air containing unhealthy ozone influences’ people’s health and extends the forest fire season……All these facts with supportive data rise people’s seriousness of the mutual problem that even we meet the goals of Paris by 2050, the earth will still be under-threat.
<br><br>
Before reading, I don’t know that all previous mass extinctions except the one which killed the dinosaurs were cause by greenhouse gas emissions. And I am really worried about some social problems raised by the climate crisis. The worsening climate will make all pandemic diseases easier to spread specifically at highly-populated but under-developed countries where people have limited access to medial care. People will pay for the climate crisis with unimaginable economic collapses in the future. There is also clearly a relationship between temperature rising and violence according to the author. What will our earth become with pandemic diseases, economic depressions and more violent wars? 
<br><br>
I can get that David Wallace-Wells is trying to tell the audience to take actions before everything is too late, but the tone of this article is overall pessimistic that “no plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.” It’s giving the readers the feeling that we can do nothing about climate because the threats are unresolvable. The earth will unquestionable meet its end. If nothing can help, what’s the purpose of this passage? Simply giving shocking facts and telling people there’s nothing they can do will not inspire people to make more environmental-healthy changes.

“The Unattainable Earth” reveals the serious consequences of climate change if people still don’y take actions. I was first surprised by the consequence of global temperature rising 2°C. On second thought, I felt angry that people and even scientists thought it was alarmist towards Wallace-Wells’ claim of acting quickly to solve global warming, since there are sufficient evidences and presented results of global warming, for example four of the five largest wildfires in California history happened this decade. Despite a tone of hopelessness throughout the text, I believe this kind of article is indispensable. While showcasing some of the worst-case scenarios that may happen, Wallace-Wells alert people to take actions to protect our Earth.

David Wallace-Wells uses this article “The Uninhabitable Earth” to give people closer attention to the current scenario in which the earth is suffering. Up to now, the earth has suffered five extinctions. Most of them are triggered by the extensive release of CO2 and methane. In the whole passage, David has tried his best to use all examples and real things happened around the earth to prove the urgency of this global warming. He explores so many examples and data that people would all find this passage persuasive. Moreover, he also mentions that the bad conditions of the earth will lead to the end of food. Although a warmer temperature will lead to better grow grains, vegetables will still die out. Actually, a lot of factors will affect the yields of plants, such as the level of soil and precipitation. As a result, the earth would face a more severe problem when drought comes. Some countries are already under famine, and some organizations are doing their best to avoid more serious conditions.

I like these articles. Since the title "The Uninhabitable Earth(or the least unwelcoming earth)" shocked many of the people, which will make people start to think about how this will hurt and affect our daily life. This makes people start to think about if we don't do anything, our children may suffer from the consequence we make. Thesecelc articles tell us a lot of truths that shock me, but we know that is true. For example, one to a two-celsius degree increase temperature is not a small thing. This may lead to the extinction of some species of animals. Also at the end of the articles, the author writes about the section on the mass extinctions: The statistic of the 97% of the population being wiped in the most recent mass extinction. This really shocked me. And let me start to envisage the problem.

<p>
"The Uninhabitable Earth" is the first in-depth article that I have read about climate change. Most articles have heavy jargon that make it hard to understand, but Wallace-Wells utilizes an alarmist approach to educate the readers. This method can seen extremely overwhelming and alarming to those who are not expecting the overload of information, but I think that it is a good wake-up call to society. We need to take action now to save our planet or else it'll be too late. The most shocking part of the article was when he consistently kept pushing out harsh truths that is leading to earth's inevitable doom. This shocked me the most because most articles keep it light hearted so that there isn't too much backlack from the audience, but Wallace-Wells went all in with his facts. I viewed this as a good thing because he's being transparent with the audience and this encourages readers to take action within their own lives.

<p>
After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth", I had a feeling that I should take action immediately about climate change, and I think everyone should do it since the problem can influence everyone. Even though some people think the article describes the problem as too optimistic, I still feel worried about the future. I think if humans don't have solutions and cope with the rising temperature, the problems that came along with it will become more and more serious, and the earth will eventually become uninhabitable, and we all have to find another place to live.

<p>
“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was a chilling article that put the severity of climate change into better perspective. It was interesting to see how much of the problem has become something that is “inevitable”. Many of the points and consequences of climate change discussed in the article seemed to be very science fiction-esque. However, after learning more about the ramifications of global warming in class and from the movie “Before the Flood”, I am starting to see it more as a reality rather than something that is so far-fetched.

I found it to be strikingly interesting about the effects climate change will have on our oceans. I always knew that our oceans were being polluted and that marine life is being threatened. However, learning about the concept of ocean acidification really changed my perspective on the harmful effects of greenhouse gases. This is a great illustration of how humans are destroying every part of the planet, even parts that should be protected such as the oceans and all of its biodiversity. 
<br><br>


Lastly, the closing statistics and facts at the end of this video really put the effects of climate change on the weather into perspective. It is a daunting reality that so much has happened over the past decade alone. It makes me wonder if stopping or slowing down climate change is even something that is possible, or if it is just a part of the earth’s evolution.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" for the fourth time as a student, I've become desensitized to the article, and it has become, dull. I no longer see it as an alarmist article, like I did when I first read it,  it was difficult for me to sleep. The one thing though that I did catch was, Wallace's criticism of hollywoods lack of films related to the climate crisis. I disagree with that. I grew up watching Wall-e and as a teen I saw Interstellar as well. Both which depict environmental destruction as a result of climate change. Wall-e is a kids film created by Disney which depicts an earth overrun by trash and an atmosphere polluted with solar panels. It is a very popular film, that gives children a glimpse into the future of  of a changing climate. It was nominated for six oscars and won best animated feature film of the year in 2008. As for interstellar,  it depicts climate change through fires, droughts, failing crops, and dust storms and was nominated for six oscars. 
<br><br>


The best part of the Uninhabitable earth after reading it so many times, is how legible it is. Anyone can read and understand Wallace's article. It's accessible. His tone was urgent and his examples were alarming. It's an accurate reflection on how dire the climate crisis is. It is alarming, to new readers, for good reason. The more educated people are on the climate crisis, the more inclined people will be to act on it.

<p>
When I was reading this article, I was worried and shocked by the impact and consequences of climate change mentioned by Wallace-Wells. This article effectively alarmed the public about the severity of climate crisis by using a passive tone and utilizing statistical data to tell the public how bad the situation was. One surprising fact to me is that the climate change is affecting not only animals and plants, but also humans. A lot of people died because of the heat caused by climate change, which tells me that if we do not take any action to stop the tendency of climate change, one day in the future, we will be hurt by climate change. Many people think Wallace too alarmist, but I do not think so, because, since climate crisis brought an impact on humans, this issue became a big issue that worth humans pay more attention to it. 
<br><br>
Commonly, for those who do acknowledge the existence of climate change, they only realize that climate change is true, but they normally do not realize how severe it is and what kind of consequences that it will bring. So Wallace’s warning is an effective information to those people and alarm them how servers the situation is, so these people could treat this issue seriously and take action to protect the earth. For those who do not pay much attention on protecting the earth before, Wallace’s language is a good tool to frighten them and let these people to realize what the earth is experiencing now, so in the future, it is likely for them to notice this issue.

<p>
It worried me how desensitized I felt to what people describe as an alarmist approach to climate change. It is undeniably a frightening future that David Wallace- Wells lays out for us, and not an exaggeration of it either, but it is also not new information in a sense. People have known about the crisis for decades. Scientists have warned us and ingrained in society’s minds for decades that no action on our behalf will result in the decimation of a whole species and earth itself. It is only now where the effects of climate change are looming that some people are beginning to look at the facts; finally looking around and seeing our earth responding in extreme, unnatural ways. For the people that have had the privilege of not having to pay much attention to the climate crisis occurring, I think this article instills great fear in them. I think that the severity of most 2050 projections are forcing people to acknowledge that something must change. And I think that at least for me (and many others, including those that have personally felt the effects of the crisis on their own lives) that already foster such a deep interest and passion for addressing the climate crisis, David Wallace-Wells’ article does not seem alarmist, but only a reiteration of what has been known for years. However, the most unnerving part of the article is that “no amount of emissions reduction alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster,” which does strike the strongest chord with me. It is hard to read and know that this crisis is already well underway and we are living in the midst of it. No matter our actions, people have died and more will continue to die, be displaced, and suffer because of a global crisis that we (even though ‘we’ is an unfair term as 1/8th of the population has created 2/3rds the world’s emissions) as a species have put upon ourselves. If anything though, it gives many people of this generation a motive to continue to try and remediate and lessen the effects of the climate crisis. This is the generation that has to be the hero.

I personally did not care about the climate and climate disaster, because I think first I could not be touching these areas since I am not a specialist, and second I did not think I can change the macroscopic situation with my strength. However, after reading this article and finishing just the three classes by professor Ken, I come to realize that the world soon, or even now, will meet great and irreversible damage that humankind had never seen. I thought I would not be affected, but now I know it is time for every person to do something to solve the problem. 

<br><br>

I always saw on TV about the hurricanes that happened in my own country or in America, where I am living right now, but it is hard to really decompose the Phenomenon and explain the reasons behind it. It is pretty shocking to know that even the hurricanes that seem to be unrelated are caused by the rise of temperature. I deeply sensed the danger by Wells' article and his feeling about the earth. 
<br><br>


Not only me but many big countries and excellent elites also had the same insights as me when I saw the Paris Agreement on the weather. And many of them did not stick to them because they think it would not influence that hard. Yes since we've been exploiting our mother for such a long time. I desire to learn more about how our actions would cause bad effects on the weather and ways to stop further worsen on the climate as a whole.

Wallace-Wells takes a doom and gloom approach of giving information about the effects climate change has on the Earth currently and in the future. When done correctly, this tactic can be helpful in getting people to understand the seriousness of the topic and I think he executes it well. He uses a lot of evidence and facts to cover a very wide range of topics that he explains in detail, laying it all out for his readers. 
<br><br>
If I didn’t take ENGL22 last quarter, I think I would be a lot more panicked than I was when I finished reading the article. I learned how to overcome the anxiety that came with knowing what is going to happen to the Earth and that the majority of people in power who can help stop it are doing nothing. While all the information he gave was worrying, I knew a lot of what is happening and what is to come if we don’t act now, but the article is still very eye-opening. 
<br><br>
For readers who may be learning this information for the first time, this tactic may turn them away and make them stop reading the article because of how depressing and anxiety-inducing the information can be. 
<br><br>
I think it is important that they touched on how climate change can start or contribute to wars, like the civil war in Syria. Poorer countries and people get the worst repercussions of climate change since they do not have the same resources as the wealthy. An example that Wallace-Wells brings up is the large number of people that have been displaced. Wealthier people can find a new place to live fairly easily while poorer people are left to wander until they can find somewhere that will let them stay. 
<br><br>
I believe that this is an article that should be read by everyone who has doubts about climate change being a serious topic. It may even help inspire readers to do their part in the fight against climate change.



</p><hr>


<p>
I approached this article with an open mind as I already am largely fearful of the mounting negative effects of climate change.  The article introduces a multitude of shocking impacts.  The crisis is thoroughly demonstrated examples provided by Wallace-Wells.  He details climate driven destruction, disease, famine, death and mutation.  He does not merely warn that these are potential consequences of human action.  The article declares that humans have already secured our bleak fate and it is only a matter of time.  This perspective could be considered alarmist especially those with a conservative outlook on the situation.  However, the notion that the information itself is alarming, does not therefore make David Wallace-Wells an alarmest with an alarmist sentiment.



</p><hr>


<p>
Wallis-Wells articles provides the necessary call to action to mitigate the threat of climate change. The article is admirably alarmingly and doesn't sugar coat information to the reader. My slim background knowledge on climate change was vastly expanded by the information provided and the grand holistic effects that are subject to climate change. I found the economic collapse section to be a compelling theme. Cashing in at the expense of our planet is unethical and a large economic crash is something I never had considered to come from climate change. The article is informative and fearful, which means there exists hope and not doom.



</p><hr>


<p>
More like Wallace is being a realist rather than an alarmist. I have been learning a lot from the article and the different factors that no one ever talks about (like the frozen diseases that will be unleashed into the world) and those that people refuse to talk about. 
<br><br>
As we all look to outreach for a better future, we put in tremendous hope that the people will somehow realize that this world needs help and we aren't doing all that we can to help them. I think with a lot of climate talks and articles present all the devastating facts about what would happen when we reach a certain level of temperature rise, this and that would happen, but in reality, it is already happening, right now. People are being affected right now everywhere around the globe. We can't keep talking about "the climate generation" as only the youth but not the actual people who are out there struggling. We can't keep talking about what would happen if inaction happened. We have to talk about what is happening now. 
<br><br>
Environmentalism, environmental justice is not just about the climate but it is also about the people, the imperialism, the colonization, the injustice, the inequity, the slavery, the prisons, the every-problem-in-this-world. If we don't have injustice around the globe, if we don't have such a big gap between the rich and poor, if we didn't have corruption, wow then maybe we won't have this severe climate change.

After reading the article "the uninhabitable earth" by david wallace i've come to the conclusion that his radical approach to show how climate change affects everybody on the planet at a deeper and more serious level is very effective at scaring his audience. Furthermore his thought provoking ideas and claims cause his audience to really think about whether to take action or give up. In my opinion I believe that some of these things will be prevented by the time that they come and that david wallace is putting an emphasis on the disastrous effects of climate change. However, david wallace does effectively display the dangers of climate change to his audience which could open there eyes to change. I believe his article is more of a wake up call with the hard facts presented as an incentive to change the future.



</p><hr>


<p>
For starters, the article covers the impacts of climate change in a much deeper and straightforward way than other articles covering climate change. Wallace-Wells takes a candid tone in his discussion of the threat of climate change. It is easy to be discouraged by the article and feel a sense of helplessness; however, it is also an opportunity to process the information and let the feelings of anger, fear, or whatever it may be, force you to do something about it. The article paints a very dire picture, but I believe that is necessary if we are to fully understand what the climate crisis holds in store for all of us. No one is safe from the impacts of climate change, no matter how much privilege, money, or power you may have. I think Wallace-Wells alarmist approach is what more writers of climate change need to be exhibiting. On one hand, this approach can force some to tune out, but if enough people have the same sense of urgency toward the issue, it is bound to start waking people up. Personally, I struggle with accepting everything that is embedded in the climate crisis. To accept what it means is to accept the systemic changes that need to be made. Many people struggle with this because we are conned into believing that we have no real impact or say in the matter; however, this is not true. We all have a role to play in solving the climate crisis, as we all have a personal stake in it.

<p>
I can say with certainty that reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells has shifted my views toward climate change. Prior to taking this course and reading the article, my views on climate change and global warming had not been the greatest. I used to think that these issues were not too prominent in our world and that everything would eventually be solved with minimal to no damage done. What I had not realized was that drastic effects were already taking place. I believe that most individuals do not take this issue into full account due to ignorance and not wanting to face reality. One issue that stuck out with me was in the eighth section, where Wallace-Wells discusses coral bleaching and the catastrophic effects that will happen to much of the marine life and half a billion people if they die out. I found this and ocean acidification especially eye-opening as I had not contemplated the effects of anthropogenic climate change on sea life. 

<br><br>

Needless to say, this article does not sugarcoat what will happen in a few years if change does not occur. Although some might label this article as alarmist or fear mongering, I believe that it is completely justified. Fear and call to action is what we need as a species to ultimately survive. It has been the driving force that has kept humanity alive all these centuries. With complacency comes catastrophe. Those naysayers who do not see this as a prominent issue have yet to come to terms with the reality they are living in.

When reading the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells it immediately filled my mind with anxiety. The type of information being given and how it was written cause my mind to wander to the worst-case scenarios, and it was only supported by the different sections in the article and how they were explained and talked about. I try to update myself on the news regarding climate change, however, when reading that no matter how well informed the reader was, we were not alarmed enough, it freaked me out. Especially when quickly scrolling through the rest of the article and seeing how long it was. 
 <br><br>
When reading about the section of heat death, my mind immediately throughout about the extreme temperatures from where I lived in the San Fernando Valley, thinking about the day it hit nearly 130 degrees. It got me wondering how much the weather had changed there where I lived and then began to think about all the other places in the world where extreme temperatures have been recorded and how quickly the numbers were getting either higher or lower. With every category that the article talked about and the impact it will have, it gave me a sense of dread that things will not get better with time, and we’ve hit a point of no return, death is our only path at this point. I felt sadness and irritation, knowing that there could have been more done sooner to help combat climate change. 
 <br><br>
There is definitely a very pessimistic tone and alarmist tone that comes within the text when you read it. I do believe that there is a good amount of risk that alienates certain readers from continuing to read about the article, due to the fear that it instills. However, I do believe that the alarmist tone must be done as this is a subject that can not be sugar-coated.

The article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells is extremely terrifying. For me, it brought the entirety of the climate crisis in view. This article was a collaboration of multiple sources and it utilized a variety of specific examples to detail the extent of the crisis. Everything that is yet to take place will have a large impact on the greater environment. As we continue to burn through fossil fuels were furthering the general warming of the planet. The hottest summers ever recorded have taken place in recent years and it’s crazy to think that with time certain places will become uninhabitable. Increased heat greatly limits our ability to produce enough crops and current systems of agriculture only further the problem. As a species, we love to consume meat, but the methane produced and resources lost could mean we have to start a shift in the systems we have in place. 
 <br><br>

Large amounts of food are wasted and as a society, it doesn’t seem like there is anything that will make us stop in the near future. It made me sad to think of how interweaved our issue really is. So much of American land and food resource goes directly into the beef industry and as a consumer, I never questioned the repercussions of this. I love having the availability to eat burgers and steak when I please, but now I’m thinking of what that means for the people outside of the U.S. Millions of people lie in poverty around the world and as the climate shifts it only worsens the situation leading to greater conflict over natural resources.

David Wallaces’s “The Uninhabitable Earth” takes an alarmist perspective on climate change and essentially makes a call to action. In this article, Wallace informs the readers of all the extreme dangers and possible outcomes that can result from climate change. The author notes that most people are, in some sense, aware of climate change but don’t exactly know the details of it or the extreme time crunch we are on before it kills us. Thus, the author takes the reader on a journey of all the possible events that are or will occur if we don’t immediately take action to stop this. The way the author worded this article definitely makes the reader prompted to action. Reading this was almost like reading a scary novel where all life on Earth comes to an end. The alarmist tactic the author used approached climate change with should not alienate any readers. This is a worldwide problem that should be addressed as such because everyone’s lives depend on it. As professor Hiltner mentioned in the video, it is unlikely that all these scenarios will fully take place, but it is definitely on our schedule. Climate change is affecting every species on earth, and will eventually kill all if we don’t do anything about it. The entire article presents hard-to-read details of the effects of climate change, but the most compelling words I read mentioned the possibility of the comeback of diseases that once killed thousands of people hidden in the permafrost. Global warming is melting the permafrost in many regions that essentially carry immense amounts of CO2 deadly to planet Earth, in addition to the disease remnants that also lay there. There is a possibility that the permafrost will essentially melt to the level in which many historic diseases remain, and there's a possibility these deadly diseases make a comeback.

After reading the article “The uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I change my views toward the climate change. Before reading it, I’m like one of the other people who’s simply optimistic about the effect of global warming.  In my view, even though the rise of temperature would cause some serious problems, there will still be solutions that will work out. However, after reading the articles, the effect of the climate change is much more serious than I thought. The articles has lists many different aspects how climate change will influence our life. One of the most serious point to me is the climate change will eventually lead to the uninhabitable land which is too hot for human to live. The article states that “at 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half of the world’s population, as distributed today, would die of direct heat.” And in addition, the article predicts that 7 degrees of warming will occur at the end of this century. If this prediction is true, then
 <br><br>
soon enough, the large scope of death due to the heat will happen. The facts lists in the article are so scary that there must  be actions on climate change. I hope human can slow down the climate change so that the catastrophic prediction won’t happen in the future

<p>
Going into David Wallace-Well’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I was surprised at the dangers of global warming being as drastic as they currently are heading into the future. Wallace-Well’s creates an alarming vision of what the world is going to be like if collective action is not immediately taken. What surprised me is the fact that areas like Miami will fall to the effects of climate change. I don’t believe that Wallace-Wells was being too alarmist as the claims he made are not overly exaggerated, but I do think his language carried a pessimistic undertone.

 <br><br>

In his concluding paragraph, Wallace-Wells repeatedly uses negative phrases hinting at impending doom, with examples being “mutually assured destruction” and “engineer[ing] our own doomday” which I believe can be misinterpreted by readers. It leaves me a bit conflicted on what I can do as an individual to advocate for change, but despite this issue I found while reading the article, Wallace-Wells did a good job in informing us about the various consequences which will occur from global warming.



</p><hr>


<p>
Reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" was honestly shocking to me. I knew that there would be dire consequences to come if climate change continues at the rate it's going, but reading the actual statistics was frightening. While most of us think of the effects like heat waves, storms, and droughts, the article outlines many effects that I'd never thought of before as being related to climate change, like economic collapse and an increase in crime rates and wars. Particularly interesting to me was the idea of "climate plagues": when large areas of ice and permafrost frost melt, it can release diseases that have been frozen for hundreds of years. Because modern humans haven't been exposed to these diseases, they won't have immunity, and the results could be disastrous.
 <br><br>

Many of our climate struggles, Wallace-Wells points out, will become self-perpetuating cycles. As temperatures rise and the icebergs begin to melt, there will no longer be that icy white surface to reflect heat, so heat will instead be absorbed and the temperatures will begin to rise even more. In the same vein, the growth of dead zones in the oceans will perpetuate the further spread of these lifeless areas. Once things hit a certain point, then, climate change will continue to worsen on its own, even if humans were to drastically reduce carbon emissions. Once we hit this point of no return, will there be anything we can do to stop climate change? And are we able to predict this point, or will we know it only once it has passed?

<p>
Reading the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells,  made me more aware of the reality and consequences of climate change. Before reading the article, I was already aware of the issues of climate change and I knew how bad it was getting but what really struck me in the article was the climate plagues section. I've never heard of that issue coming up and to be honest, it is pretty terrifying to even think about. Diseases that have been frozen long before us being unfrozen and let back out into the world is absurd. Another point that I completely agree with is the lack of realization of climate change to the society. I know people who just shrug the idea off like it is nothing. The question is though, is it their fault for not seeing the reality and the consequences that are to come? I always hear people talk about climate change but I hardly ever hear people talk about the consequences and what we will face due to climate change. This article shows exactly that, people need to read it. People need to be talking more about climate change often and daily. Before reading the article, I didn't even realize all of these issue that will be caused from climate change so I know there are a lot others who don't know these too.
 <br><br>

In regards to the alarmist attitude, I think it is a justified approach. Climate Change is something that needs to be taken seriously. Also his attitude alarms us the issues we will face if we don't act now and quickly. His tone made me more aware of the issues at hand and makes me want to share with others the consequences of climate change and what will happen if we don't act now and do something about it. People are stubborn and may not want to see the harsh reality but if everyone is talking about it and alarming the people will hopefully light a fire under them in hopes they hop up and do something about it too.



</p><hr>


<p>
When I began reading the article I had my own ideas of what I was to expect, the reiteration of the same information we"ve been hearing for years in a different wrapping. Yes the ice caps are melting, oceans rising, and it's all happening too fast and it's all gonna be a hot mess, quite literally. It was so refreshing to read an article that took into account the crisis looking at the different aspects of human life that would be affected, some I hadn't thought of. The idea that because the global temperature will continue to rise for the foreseeable future, and that might further initiate wars and conflicts all around the world struck me as something almost inconceivable, maybe fictitious. Climate change causing WWIII amongst other possibilities is a concept I am very interested in looking into, not everyone considers the violent implications of climate change every day. 
 <br><br>

As for the idea that Wallace-Wells portrays possibly too much of an alarmist tone into "The Uninhabitable Earth", I completely disagree with it. I think that the alarmist message is perfectly implicated in the article in a way that gives off a sense of urgency to the matter, almost stirring the reader to seek change, without being overbearing and in your face about the issue. He makes it very clear the most likely gloomy scenarios we will face in our lifetimes, but he ends with the message that "yeah we did this to ourselves, but in some way, we have to find our way out of it or at least how to manage it". Wallace's alarmist approach hits us hard with the climate change reality stick, but gives us a band-aid and encourages us to get it together, urging us in the right direction.



</p><hr>


<p>
In the article “The Unhabitable Earth”, Wallace-Wells listed almost every kind of possible disasters that might cause fatal problems or even extinction to human. The consequences of global warming are much severer than we might have imagined. I was taught that there have been several extinctions before the existence of human, but I never know that the main cause of most of these mass extinctions is greenhouse gases. Human are in a more dangerous situation than we used to believe it is, because the greenhouse gases has reached a level that might have never been met before. 
 <br><br>

Human race is just a corner of the earth’s history. A lot of people might think that we would always have a brighter future and that everything would work out smoothly in the end. Just because we are human and have the intelligence that other creatures. However, the confidence is causing ignorance. People tend to believe the good things than the bad, but Wallace-Wells pulls us back to the existing problems. Admittedly, Wallace-Wells’ article will cause panic, and he gives the reader a feeling that everyone is doomed. However, I believe he is not an alarmist. We have been living optimistically for too long that we neglect a lot of real problems we are facing. The consequences, or the “end of human” that Wallace mentioned, not just serves for frightening people, but are inevitable, not if we start immediately to do something that slows down the process. 
 <br><br>

An old saying says that it is always not too late to start, but this saying does not work on our current situation. We should be aware that things can be irreversible if we reach some point where our earth can no longer take on what we have consumed and spoiled. Wallace-Wells warns us that we must start before it is too late. The problem he addressed is what all human should be aware of, and the responsibility of future lies with every one of us.

David Wallace-Wells takes on an interesting approach in his New York Times article “The Uninhabitable Earth”. He begins establishing his stance by criticizing those who do not recognize or advocate for action against climate change, more specifically targeting their definition of the issue as well as their perspective. Some of the climate change deniers defend a more central point of view, focusing on places in which the effects of climate change has imposed its worse outcomes; claiming this perspective as opposed to a larger international scale analysis presents the dangers of misidentifying and ignoring patterns of occurrences that are of equal concern to other disastrous situations. Along with this, the depictions of the issue are distorted from manipulation of data from some climate scientists as well as the subtle, if not outright romanticization of it in the realm of media and film. For the rest of the article, Wallace-Wells dramatizes and hyperbolizes the future conditions of this planet, given that we do not initiate aggressive action combating climate change. In a way, this can be seen as a double edged sword. By showcasing the potential calamity in continuing the way we live today, there sets off the alarm of desperation and provokes the conversation of what hard measures need to be taken as well as the steps we can take to get to a common goal of alleviating the planet we live on of the destructive elements we have released. Through this same method of maintaining an alarmist stance, there suggests little hope of recovery. He analyzes the effects of climate change considering the current practices and choices of our planet’s population as a whole today from every space of the earth, from land to sky to sea. 
 <br><br>
Also, the writer discusses the lifestyles changes forced upon wildlife and humans alike from the progression of climate change. Take ocean acidification. The ocean absorbed a third of the carbon particles circulating the air and the excessive amounts of this element have been a main factor contributing to the phenomenon of coral bleaching and the diminished integrity of some animals’ protective mechanisms. Accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the length and quality of our lives; economically and politically, the exchange of fossil fuels and similar resources establishes an influential platform for big corporations that invest their dollars into expanding measures that would increase our footprint. Diseases and other conditions have begun resurfacing from the fossilized materials and organisms of millions of years ago because of increased temperatures that lead to the rapid melting of the ice they were preserved in. Personally, I think that the strategy of outlining the consequences to our actions eliminates any possible sugarcoating of climate change. However, because of how robust the content and argument is within the piece, I would not see this reading as being accessible to some readers and the beliefs they may strongly adhere to.



</p><hr>


<p>
I approached the article with the expectation that David Wallace-Wells would paint a very pessimistic picture of this planet's future. In many ways this was the case, almost every given projection or testimony by a climate scientist was grim. 100s of million of lives are going to be directly affected before the end of the century. A very important piece of context given in the article is the climate crisis is occurring alongside what is very likely the Earth's sixth mass extinction. Even if the geological and climate changes that have already occurred are not enough evidence, the very rapid rate of plant and animal species going extinct resulting in decreasing biodiversity is very alarming. As a species humans are overstepping the planets' limits to support us. When approaching the problem there has to be wholesale consideration for how a species as advanced as humans can exist within a planetary ecosystem. Taking an alarmist stance, which I believe Wallace-Wells does is necessary. Without severe action in the near future humans will suffer give consequences while the core problem becomes harder to solve. It is a very powerful feedback loop that needs to be addressed with urgency, the range of outcomes suggested by Wallace-Wells are all futures I think every person would want to avoid.

Reading David Wallace’s Article “The Uninhabitable Earth” again, as I first read it three months ago, still arose the same emotions in me when I read it the first time. I felt fearful, apprehensive, and immensely alarmed. The very first time I came across the article, I felt all of these emotions but did not yet know the true importance of feeling these certain emotions. As the article progresses, Wallace’s use of negative diction sets a serious and alarming mood which can ultimately cause people to take the climate crisis more seriously. He does not sugar coat anything, but instead shows it how he views it: a serious, dangerous problem that needs society to help solve it. We can see this through the comparisons he uses, such as “Humans, like all animals are heat engines…having to continually cool off, like panting dogs”, or even with his eye-catching headers, “Doomsday”, “End of  food”, “Perpetual War”, etc.  He goes into detail with how climate change would affect various aspects of the world such as the economy, food supply, war, air quality, and so much more. He makes sure to list all these dangers to open people’s mind up to this complex and huge problem. 
 <br><br>

After the second reading, I now see how important it was for me to feel these emotions about the article. Wallace intends for readers to feel something that can spark a flame or lead to a step in the direction of being part of the change. This article shows the seriousness of this grand issue and the various types of ways it can negatively affect the world, which if not stopped can one day leave the planet uninhabitable.

David Wallace-Well’s, ”The Uninhabitable Earth”,  is alarming and rightfully so in an attempt to shatter complacency caused by an uninformed public. I think an alarmist approach, while it may stir fear, is the most effective way of stressing the urgency behind the catastrophic problem we're facing. He risks incapacitating people with fear but behind the fear is the reality that the way humanity is currently operating is not working and will not work for much longer with the only solution being to drastically change the way we live. After reading the article it's difficult to launch into action because it seems that any efforts will be futile since the damage we’ve caused burning fossil fuels is irreversible.

After reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by Wallace-Wells, I suddenly had an awareness of our planet situation and urgency to contribute or act in some effective ways to help some organizations on this severe issue. In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, the author summarizes several main probable consequences if our earth is continuously devastated by human and non-human factors. I also agree with the idea that some people still do not realize the severity of the climate issue and ignore the warnings from some experts and climatologists. If we want to make our earth more habitable, everyone should at least have urgency and desire to try their best to contribute in numerous ways. I believe that people do not want to just see our earth is destroyed. We need to make some actions rather than just read to listen to some reports regarding the climate issue. Acting properly is the most effective way to show that you are concerned with climate change. A set of data in this reading impress me a lot as it strongly demonstrates how one of our biggest issue—temperature rise—effectively influence every aspect of our planet. According to the World Bank, the coolest month in tropical South America are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century (par.13. Wallace-Wells). It is astonishing and unbelievable due to the fact the temperature rises so quickly that a lot of people had never imagined before. As the temperature continues to rise and gets hotter and hotter, our life will be threatened because of the high temperature. Therefore, I believe that the warmer temperature is one of the most urgent and serious problems we face because it causes other issues indirectly.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, he brings an alarmist attitude to the threat of climate change for the Earth. By explaining various ways that we are threatened by climate change in the future and today Wallace truly paints a picture of the immense scope of the future devastation that is awaiting us. It is amazing how little the general populous cares about the issue of climate change. Many people think that they will not live to see the effects or just do not believe in it. An interesting part of the article is the fourth section where Wallace brings up that there are ancient viruses and plagues that can be defrosted due to climate change. This is just one of many issues that could wipe out humanity, I would've never even thought it was a possibility, we might not even have predicted yet the fall of the human race yet because the issue of climate change is so vast and affects so many aspects of the entire earth.

After reading the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” I was in complete shock to see how our earth would end up, with the climate change. The author goes through different scenarios, presenting the consequences in the future if we don’t change. Before reading this I didn’t know how much of an impact climate change does to us, I thought it would simply cause the earth to get hotter and the ice would melt as well as raise sea levels. 
 <br><br>
From this article I found the heat death to be important since we would die from diseases such as in the sugarcane region of El Salvador, where one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease. This shows that we will all get a disease and if it’s not by the heat, the air quality will also be dangerous. It is said that by 2090 as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the WHO “safe” level. These facts simply show that it’ll be impossible to stay alive in an inhabitable earth.

While I have heard a lot of information on how climate change has been affecting the planet in recent years and how it will only get worse, David Wallace-Wells’s highly descriptive article “The Uninhabitable Earth” explains the consequences of climate change in the foreseeable future which makes me further realize the severity of the issue. There seems to be a stronger emphasis on current events and a generalization on the impact of climate change in later decades, so Wallace-Well’s article is a good additional source of information based on scientific projections. I would say that even though the content in the article may invoke fear in a way that would categorize Wallace-Wells as an alarmist, he has sources to support the ideas that are being mentioned and thus should be spreading awareness about the predicted reality of climate change. He is taking action that goes along with James Hansen who, as noted in the text, criticizes other scientists for not conveying just how disastrous the planet will be due to current human action. I feel that this is necessary to inform others about specific aspects of climate change that are important, yet generally less discussed, as it is one thing to assume that humanity will one day collapse, but another to explain how greenhouse gases will lead to that downfall through crop failures, diseases, air pollution, and such.
 <br><br>
I think that the most compelling part of the article was the section on how the warming of the planet and the increase of droughts will lead to lower crop yields and, in turn, less food to feed the population. It is predicted that most of the current sources for food cannot be relied upon in the future. This sounds like a huge problem since food production has become industrial, which leads to the question of how people will be able to survive without those sources of food. Furthermore, because the population continues to grow and millions of people are already not consuming a sufficient amount of food necessary for survival, temperature rises are definitely a concern as to how people can sustain themselves. And this is only one of the many concerns in the future which shows how life on earth is at risk if we continue using up fossil fuels.

In the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” by David Wallace-Wells, he goes into great detail about the potential consequences of climate change. Before reading this article, I was aware that climate change had its consequences, however I was never really sure of what those consequences entailed. What caught my attention the most was the fourth section of his article titled, “Climate Plagues,” he discusses how the climate, specifically high temperatures, can influence a rapid reproduction of certain diseases, reintroduce ancient bugs, and release other diseases and bacteria that has been trapped in ice. I was stunned to find this information out because it is so new to me, since I have never heard of those possibilities before.  
 <br><br>
Wallace-Wells did an excellent job at explaining the various effects that climate change may have on the planet. Reading this article has worried me even more about the climate crisis that we are putting the Earth through.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” David Wallace-Wells speaks the ugly truth in regards to climate change. Wallace-Wells was blunt in with his points about the global temperatures rising, creating unpleasant images of what life will be like on Earth if action is not taken soon. Through his tone and imagery I felt a sense of fear in regards to what my future would look like if continued with the way we are going. Although I had a basic understanding of the consequences of climate change, I did not know the severity of them. Many people are optimistic and believe that if we act quick enough we can solve all of our problems, however Wallace makes a point that this is a figment of our imagination. Even though our actions can solve this issue to a certain extent, many of the consequences are inevitable such as the disappearance of Miami florida and Bangladesh due to the rising sea levels. I do not believe Wallace is an alarmist. He is stating facts and is trying to create a sense of urgency into the public to take action to better our future here on Earth.

As a college student living in the 2000s and being somewhat socially aware, I believed to have had a basic understanding and insight on global warming or rather our "climate crisis". With this in mind, through reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth", I was expecting to get some more in-depth info on mainly CO2 pollution and how to better regulate emissions, whether this was through Tesla's plan of going all-electric or insisting on stricter regulations for big corporate companies, I had my money on this being the main point. However, while these points were slightly mentioned, it was much more than that. In fact, with multiple organized sections, I quickly realized just how little I knew. While CO2 emissions were, of course, a part of our problem, I had no idea of the threats we were releasing through the melting of the ice. With hidden gasses and notorious diseases, the melting ice caps suddenly became a much larger deal to me and persuaded me into wanting to take action and research more about the details of our climate crisis.
 <br><br>


While this bit of fear from hidden dangers within the polar ice caps could be viewed as an alarmist tactic, I did not mind it, in fact, I am appreciative of it as it serves to be a slap of reality to me and all other uninformed readers. This persuasion through fear promotes readers to take action by learning more about the subject matter and seeing in which ways they can help support the cause as they become aware of the direct consequences that are soon to come if action is not taken. Some readers may respond to this alarmist tactic by accepting defeat and claiming "it's too late for any action to be worthwhile", however, I truly believe this article serves to be effective as in the very least it is still making more and more people aware of our impending climate crisis.

David Wallace-Well's approach in "The Uninhabitable Earth" is effective in that it carries out a balance between nourishing readers with facts but also giving readers a little taste of the catastrophic damage that we are inducing on our planet. Unlike other sources concerning the issue of climate change, Wells approaches the issue not by attacking the individual, but, instead, shifts his focus to covering each danger, (or side effect if you will) of climate change on a global scale. Wells covers a wide range of  information to get his idea across; from potential war to economic damage; not only did he reinforce my understanding of aspects that I was already familiar with, but exposed me to topics which I had never even considered to be part of packaged deal which we as humans gifted ourselves. For example, Wells proposed that an never-ending war and rapid economic decline are concerns to be mindful of. While these events carry an ''alarmist'' tone, Wells is sure to include his positive expectation that just as man engineered his way into this massive climate mess, hoping that man will also re-engineer his way out, and reverse the possibilities of full-fledged war and economic depressions. You see, David Wallace-Wells offers an approach like none other that I have read. Essentially, what he is doing is, presenting the reader with the facts and alarming hypothetical situations that have potential to occur if we, as the human race continue in our environmental ignorance. Quite frankly, I suppose that I never really understood the severity of the impact that just a couple degrees in temperature could have such a profound effect, so much so that waling around in the tropics (with such humidity) could leave a person fried within minutes. His examples are alarming and indeed, they are quick to instill fear into the reader but in a sense, I feel that Wells is saying: do what you will with these ideas, its up to humanity as a whole to wake up and respond to this urgent call to action.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells offers a brief synopsis of the possible realities of climate change, several already in effect. He expands on the chain of reactions to highlight the interconnectedness of the situation to tie in all aspects of climate change from ocean acidity to food. I'm not sure I agree with the term "alarmist" being used to describe this approach to the matter, "urgent" seems more appropriate of a term to describe the approach, and with good reason. I'm curious about the possibility of our climate crisis being inevitable, but sped up because of our actions. I'm also curious about the state of the Earth after the end of humanity, and how it will cope this time around, as the article mentions that mass extinction has obviously occurred before. I guess I'm wondering, in the least nihilistic manner, if this is a reality humans must accept, whether it's natural or not. In the grand scheme of things, we're just random beings on a random rock. However, I recognize the privilege in being able to even consider these possibilities, due to the fact that impoverished and exploited countries will be the first to face the true effects of this crisis. In fact, after having watched and read the remainder of the week's material, I retract my curiosity. The climate crisis does not seem to be a sped up natural occurrence,  instead it is a direct impact of the exploitation of resources for capitalistic gain.

In the article, "The Unhabitable Earth", it discusses the effects of climate change on earth as well as our human lives. I believe David Wallace-Wells is not an alarmist as he is only underlining and addressing the issue of global warming and its massive scale to the public. He understands the crisis state we are in and I think people should comprehend the difference between alarmism and realism. The article outlines how the future will look if more action is not taken to prevent climate crisis. Rather than focusing on solutions, it lists the horrifying scenarios of what could be coming in the not distant future. He also points out that the bigger problem of this situation is the number of people and government who recognize such problems are not taking action to deal with it. Its more important than ever to have change in our stewardship towards our planet if we still want to call it home. Most of the damage has been done since we first discovered about climate change around 2000 and its responsibility belongs to a single generation- ours.

After reading David Wallace-Wells's article titled, "The Uninhabitable Earth," I found myself very much resonating with his viewpoint on climate change, despite critics labeling him as an alarmist. In my opinion, he is anything but. Nations across the globe, including those who have fully acknowledged the profound effects climate change has had on the planet, simply aren't doing enough to avoid the consequences brought about by wasteful human activities. Because of this, I very much appreciated when Wallace-Wells painted a grim yet very realistic scenario brought about by anthropogenic climate change, one that blew well past the goal of limiting global warming to a 2-degree increase since that has proven to only be inevitable, regardless of the planet-saving countermeasures we try to implement and enforce. His clear portrayal of the variety of problems such as decreasing crop yields, plagues released by melting ice, air pollution, forced migration, and economic downfalls that arise from alarming increases in greenhouse gas emissions that turn out to be 10x faster than typical extinction-event rates, even when compared to an event that annihilated 97% of all life on Earth all serve as a necessary wake-up call, but also leave me feeling defeated and utterly helpless, just considering the fact that even adequately addressing the issue globally with the collaboration of many governments wouldn't be enough. If a large-scale effort won't suffice, I find it hard to believe that any personal efforts I make to combat climate change will yield any tangible results. In conclusion, I think that David's "alarmist" views on climate change are actually some of the most honest, realistic portrayals of the foreseeable future that we can barely do anything about. Something like the Paris Agreement will never suffice; we need to take meaningful action on a large scale now, not just say that we will do something eventually. That eventuality may never come.

I found Wallace-Wells’ claims to be extremely effective in eliciting both an emotional and logical response from readers. I liked the style in which Wallace-Wells conveyed this information, as I don’t think that this issue can be taken lightly any longer. Although I can see how Wallace-Wells could be perceived as an alarmist, I do not think this information can be discussed without it being seen as frightening due to the severity of the issue. I believe that, at the rate in which we are destroying our environment, this method of providing information on the climate crisis is the most necessary and hopefully the most effective. The state of the environment has obviously deteriorated in recent decades, and will continue to do so, but with far more devastating consequences. Wallace-Wells makes this clear for his readers, as the damage caused towards environment will only continue to worsen if we do not take action. I appreciate that the author explains multiple ways in which our environment will inevitably react to mistreatment, as giving specific examples allows for readers to get a more clear image of what our future could look like.
 <br><br>

I appreciate that Wallace-Wells does not shy away from pointing out the severity of these issues as I believe many people choose to remain ignorant to mankind’s effects on the environment. It is much better, however, to take preventative action than to try to undo the problems we have created on our planet. Another point that I agreed with from the article was the idea that the least privileged groups will suffer the most from the climate crisis and its effects, despite not having as much of an impact on the environment as big corporations or more privileged groups. Although this information can be incredibly disheartening to read about, I find that it motivates me to do my part in preventing further damage to our planet. I found that, overall, this article was effective and hopefully had a similar impact on other readers.

Upon Wallaces’ article I could not wrap my head around the fact of how alarming climate change is affecting our way of living just this past decade. All because we as humans are either too lazy to do something about it, or they don’t want to come to terms that it’s indeed a huge problem. Polluting the earth’s atmosphere and contributing to it on a day-to-day basis only worsens the situation. At first I felt that whatever we do now to prevent further of a threat won’t change years and years of damage to what has been already done to the earth’s environment. After reading this article, Wallace provides such insight and perspective on the future for the planet. By taking an alarmist tactic on this issue is probably one of the more efficient ways of informing these new readers, however it shouldn’t be to the extent were these alarmist are forcing something onto them.

The first article assigned for this course called “The Uninhabitable Earth”. The author David Wallace perceptively apprehends the interest in the climate crisis and addresses it with the following consequences such as starving, heat death, perpetual war, and even the permanent economic collapse. He guides the terrible idea of “doomsday” in the introductory part and demonstrates the claim that if humanity doesn’t interfere with the modern condition, the end of the world will reach in the near future. 
 <br><br>
I believe most people know that climate change is happening, we know that transformation needs to take place, we understand that we aren’t doing enough, but we do not have a clear conception of what our future takes. This article walks the audiences through many of the advances we can anticipate to observe in our lifetimes if things keep appearing the way we do.
 <br><br>
In his article, David reinforces that scientists still don’t completely comprehend what appeared, or what they missed, so we as the ordinary individuals are far less aware of the current disastrous planet. While it’s our responsibility to change this environmental destruction and make it a comfortable place for all living beings. Overall, the article was an engaging read. The article covered many different materials and was efficient in not only sending information but also expressing emotion to the reader. I would like to recommend this article to my friends.

In the reading “The uninhabitable Earth”, the author David Wallance-Wells illustrates the consequences of climate change. From my point of view, it can be divided into two main aspects-human and environment. Melted ice will cause sea level rise 60-70 meters globally. Furthermore, the ocean has absorbed most of the carbon dioxide for human while, at the same time, this absorption adds acidification to the ocean which results in the damage to the marine ecosystem and reduce marine animal population.
 <br><br>
As a result of the damage in the environment, human beings will largely be affected. First and foremost, global warming will, someday, raise the global temperature to a level which human cannot bear and thus cause violence worldwide, as well as economic collapse. In addition, with the increase in population, there will be a world with certain fractions of hungered population. What’s more, virus of diseases thousands of years ago may spread out, accompanied by the melting of ice.

In "The Uninhabitable Earth", David Wallace-Wells takes a dramatic yet unconventional role in the climate change debate. Instead of using the piece to advocate for a certain political or economic idea, he uses hard data and evidence to create a factually correct illustration of one future possible scenario. The scene he describes is gruesome: humans literally being cooked alive, entire cities and civilizations being erased by massive flooding, crop failure and starvation, destroyed ecosystems and extinction. The tone is brutal and apocalyptic, and it's certainly startling enough to grab the attention of even the most adamant of climate deniers. It's important to recognize that the purpose of Wallace-Well's article was not to make a direct prognostication about the future state of the Earth, but rather to conjure images so frightening that it inspires a sense of urgency in any and all readers. By being as dramatic as possible while staying within the domain of factual evidence, he makes an important contribution to the social discourse surrounding this pressing issue.
 <br><br>

One of the issues that I found most interesting in this article was the severity of the melting permafrost. This issue has many terrifying components. The albedo effect and the positive feedback loops involved with the melting ice introduce the idea that the climate crisis will only continue to accelerate in magnitude and violence. I was also interested by the amount of organic matter that is trapped in the ice near the poles. The amount of carbon released by the permafrost melting has the potential to be catastrophic. And even more frightening, the idea that dangerous diseases could be released with the melting ice has the potential to destabilize all life on Earth.

After reading the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, my mindset over the climate crisis had changed. At first, my previous knowledge over the topic only revolved around the excessive CO2 emissions and drastic changes in temperature around the globe, such as the rising temperatures. This article really opened my mind to the subject and made me realize that there is so much more information behind the topic than what news articles and other news providers tell us. 
 <br><br>
David Wallace-Wells uses an alarmist approach to present various catastrophic events in order to catch the audience's attention and bring forth the importance of climate change. One of the particular topics he explores is "The End of Food" in which he acknowledges that hunger is already a problem in our world and could potentially be the "doomsday" that we could expect. He supports all of the events with research and statistics, which not only adds ethic but also adds more fear for the audience. After reading the article, I for sure was impacted by his words and I am really intrigued by the topic overall.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” David Wallace-Wells conveys the alarming effects of climate change. Before reading this article, I did not know much about the climate crisis. The article was very informative and Wallace-Wells provides many points that are backed up with solid evidence. After reading this article, I definitely feel prompted to action. Even though Wallace-Wells is known as an alarmist, I believe it is a justified position as there has been a lack of movement in combating the climate crisis. The alarmist attitude really conveys the urgency and seriousness of the climate crisis. 
  <br><br>

The issues in the article that really caught my attention are heat death and the end of food. Living in an area where air conditioning is easily accessible, a few degrees of temperature increase does not sound too alarming to me. But this article really put the issue into perspective for me. I had not thought about the areas in the world that are much warmer and unable to access air conditioning. According to Wallace-Wells “by the end of the century, the World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century. I think this is a really startling estimation that puts the severity of the climate crisis into perspective for me. It makes sense that changes with the climate would affect crops. But, I had never thought about the severity of the issue. It is predicted that for crops “for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent.” This is a significant amount of food that will be lost. Overall, this article has been extremely informational and makes me want to take action.

<p>
The article “The Uninhabitable Earth” reflects the reality of Earth and the serious consequence of the climate change if we don't put in any actions. David Wallace-Wells is at an alarmist position, inspiring the readers with more solemn words. He explained in detail what  the world would be if the global temperature raises two to four degrees. I believe this type of article is better than that of articles which only appeal to readers to protect the environment. Wallace makes the reader realize the what we should do in order to reduce the risk of climate change. 
  <br><br>
The article also makes me realize the climate change would completely affect our next generations. Even though we would not suffer the direct consequence of the climate change, our kids and grandkids would be affected. If people realize now we start to do something to change the consequence, it would be less influential in the next few decades. People in the future would also have a better life.

After reading the article, "the Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace, I was filled with frustration and sadness. As suggested by Professor Hiltner, the article made me want to “sit down and cry.” Although already aware of the consequences of our anthropogenic actions, the article made me think about the ignorance and selfishness within society’s inability to accurately address this issue. Specifically, in regard to the fairly recent decision by the Trump administration to officially withdraw from the Paris Agreement, accurately illustrates how American society is accelerating our inevitable 'dooms day.' Additionally, the US is politically and economically driven by the fossil fuel industry, which allows climate denial to sweep across the country. Although a global crisis, this decision made by the second largest polluter ultimately jeopardizes the entire world. It is frustrating that politics can turn scientific fact into something controversial. The corruption within politics allows for scientists, climatologists, researchers and experts in the subject to be completely disregarded if not aligned with the political agenda. I’m saddened and frustrated that economic gain holds higher importance than all life forms on Earth. 
  <br><br>

I believe the article is rightfully illustrated by an alarmist outlook. Our current way of living, specifically in the United States, is becoming unsuitable for human survival. Wallace addresses the consequences of what the world will soon be like without proper action. Suggesting that the warming of the planet will soon cause parts of the world to be uninhabitable and as a result, social, economic, and political issues will emerge across the globe as the climate geographically alters the face of the earth. Impacting all segments of society, the climate crisis is unquestionably a literal crisis for the survival of mankind. Wallace briefly discusses how the Earth has experience five extinctions throughout its history.  The most alarming aspect about the climate crisis is not whether or not we are killing our Earth, but rather the fact that we are creating an Earth that will soon be inhabitable for human survival. Since the Earth has survived five extinctions, merely suggests it will survive the next, with or without human assistance.

Wallace-Wells’ “the uninhabitable earth” explains the urgency of stopping climate change. He truly believes that there are severe consequences to climate change if we do not act quickly. The specific effects of climate change aren’t confirmed but the dynamic set forth by Wallace Wells, this issue cannot be set aside for later. One of the most URGENT thing to do.

In reply to the compelling issues and consequences that are predicted of climate change, they are accurate and need to be given light to. Scientists are very smart but just need to be more consistent as some literally do not have knowledge over the climate patterns.

From reading Wallace-Wells’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I’ve learned better about a phenomenon that I have always been aware of but not quite able to describe or explain: In the article, he suggests: “No matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough.” Why do some people show numbness and even indifferences toward the slow but critical climate changes, which they can observe and confirm with their own eyes? He answers this question brilliantly: “Aversion arising from fear is a form of denial too.” Indeed, when facing difficulties that are almost certainly unsolvable by future innovations; When it comes to a situation that we need to give up the comfortable, luxurious and high-carbons lifestyle willingly. People are likely to feel disturbed and repulsive automatically at first.

  <br><br>

       Similar to when facing great threats that trigger “fight or flight”, people certainly are less willing to “fight” as that means they will fight themselves. Thus, they choose the “flight” option, which makes them ignoring and denying facts. Moreover, the world is too used to running the “engine” that heats up everything at the same time sustains the power needed to keep up the competitions to survive. We certainly can’t expect scientists using “timid” language will be able to convince politicians to give up part of the power they process only because of  “mere possibilities,” that will be as difficult as curing addictions. The things are, it’s the nature of science that provides scientists open-mind for endless possibilities. They are already doing their best slowing down climate changes and thinking of new ways of surviving in future’ extreme climate. On the other hand, politicians, and governors are the ones with the true power to manage the operation mode of our society, a heavier duty rest on their shoulders. In the end, it’s really up to us to decide whether we should “fight” or “flight”. Accept, spread the information, finally start to change, or denial it used to be.

As dopamine rushing through addicts’ brains without constrains, they are no longer willing to give up the unstable lifestyle that will eventually lead to their own destruction.

Although many articles have been written about the effects of climate change, the consequences of rising global temperatures are often presented with very little urgency for immediate change. "The Uninhabitable Earth", written by David Wallace-Wells, presents the climate change dilemma with a fresh perspective that educates its readers about the dire effects of global warming, while also inspiring readers to take individual action. Wallace-Wells does a wonderful job breaking down the effects of climate change in a way that is easy to understand without sacrificing the sense of urgency that is needed to convey the severe threat climate change poses to our planet. I really enjoyed how the article focused on how global warming would affect a variety of global necessities such as biodiversity, sustainable levels of agriculture, and healthy levels of air quality. Additionally, I believe that Wallace-Wells made a very strong argument by presenting information about how global warming would affect human health and international relations. This well-rounded approach gave me a better perspective of how global warming can affect almost every aspect of our daily lives.

I believe that Wallace-Well's alarmist tone is necessary to convince people of the imminent consequences global warming will have on our planet within the next few decades. I appreciate that this article used specific examples of how global warming will have severe effects on certain regions across the globe if action isn't taken immediately. I think that countries that face such immediate danger are often left out of the conversation when it comes to addressing the threat of global warming. It is essential that all nations and regions are accounted for when making environmental policies that are meant to protect populations from the threat of global warming. In addition to making eco-friendly changes to my own life-style, this article has inspired me to learn more about what actions can be taken to help limit the affects of global warming before it is too late.

David Wallace-Wells piece “The Uninhabitable Earth” deepened my understanding of the adverse effects of climate change and global warming. I was not completely shocked because I was aware of the detrimental potential of global warming due to reading several articles regarding the estimated number of displaced climate migrants that will arise due to climate change. These populations of migrants were primarily constituted of vulnerable countries that do not have access to resources that will aid them in the occurrence of a catastrophic event triggered by rising temperatures. I do not think that Wallace was too alarmist. If anything, I believe that it is extremely important to present this information in such manner so that the least at-risk populations, who are readily equipped with the tools and resources to combat rising temperatures, are exposed to the unimaginable reality that is waiting to happen. I can contest that many of us often take our privileges for granted, being that we do not encounter extreme temperatures, food shortages, or natural disasters on a daily basis, as opposed to more at-risk countries. If the media is swayed by sugar coated climate “facts” that undermine the severity of the detriment encapsulated by  climate change.
  <br><br>
One of the most intriguing facts that I read is centered around the wet-bulb temperature, in which the temperature is measured as a damp sock containing a thermometer is swung in the air, ultimately representing heat and humidity. Wallace explains how the “red line” for habitability is marked at 35 degrees celsius, while most regions are currently measuring a wet-bulb temperature of 26-27 degreses. This statement is alarming because most current wet-bulb maximums are only 8-9 degrees away from the red-line. Similarly, the rising in temperatures will also have a strong impact on plants and crops. I was most surprised to learn that crop yields decline by 10 percent for every degree of warming, with some estimates reaching as high as 17 percent. With this in mind, Wallace concurs that there would be 50 percent less grain to feed the fast growing population if the planet’s temperature rises by 5 degrees at the end of the century. Until now, I never conceptualized the connection between food and climate change. Again, I believe it is important to remember that those who will face this climate change aftermath are vulnerable populations, which is why this information must be broadcasted to those of us with privilege and power.

What most suprised me about this article was the realization of how incorrect my assumptions were about the future of climate change. As David Wallace Wells said, “when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination.” While I’ve taken classes on the current state of the climate and the various factors and events happening around the world, I never took the time to think about possible futures beyond a burning wasteland. “Heat death” sounds horrific. Reading Wallace-Well’s point about air conditioning stuck out to me because it wasn’t until I had already scrolled down to the next section that I realized the implications of turning on air conditioning and hiding from heat that is killing the rest of the world. I scrolled back up actually, and took a second to think about my privlidge as someone who has always been able to go inside and escape the heat that is killing people across the world even without the full “Heat Death”  situation. Additionally, the regions that would be most affected (around the equators) such as countries in South America and Africa, would suffer first when they are not the main contributors. This I think goes back to your lecture on Friday about climate justice and environmental injustice.  
  <br><br>
I learned for the first time about the possibility of everyone starving to death due to crop failure. I, unfortunately, also learned about the possible release of new super plagues. That totally does not sound fun. However it is fascinating how ice can trap viruses for hundreds (millions?) of years and for the viruses to still be viable when they are released. The report of the 20 people infected by released Anthrax is a scary glimpse of the future. Currently, we are able to counteract short droughts, food shortages, and virus outbreaks in America with modern technology. However once the entire planet is under siege from all angles by nature, the world economy has collapsed, and everyone is panicking, these problems will become unfixable. The “rolling death smog” is so freaky to me I’m going to try to move on from that one. Big no thanks there. 
  <br><br>
I think switching planets is a lot of work for an issue we can fix on this planet. I understand that there are complicated politics and economics involved in cutting carbon emissions and cleaning up America’s footprint, but one would think the literal impending end of humanity would be a good enough incentive to take some action. In the above video, I was shocked by the flimsiness of the Paris agreement. I was not aware that the plans relied only on the promuses of one government to another with no system in place to hold themselves accountable. It also stressed to me that in order to grind the gears of the climate crisis a little the world is going to have to find a way to work together. Of course the massive amounts of waste and carbon the US puts into the atmosphere is nothing compared to that of Iceland or Africa, but we need lower emitting countries to stand up to powerhouses like China and America and force them to do what they seem too cowardly to comit to; make a serious and drastic change to the way they operate. 
  <br><br>
I appreciated Wallace-Well’s attention to the individual scientists he mentions and their research. Learning about the amount of people who are dedicated to studying and reducing the effects of the climage crisis is reassuring and inspiring. Especially the older scientists who had been fighting for so long and continue to hold out hope. As David Wallace-Wells writes, “We will find a way to forestall radical warming, they say, because we must.”

<p>
Is David Wallace-Wells a true alarmist? Does he instill too much fear in his readers? Does taking alarmist tactics risk alienating his readers? The answer to those three major questions yes. While reading, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” by David Wallace-Wells, I couldn’t help but think about the unsurprising future doom of our planet and humanity. Even though we have top scientists that are able to make educated predictions about what is to come, they are just predictions. No one truly knows the answer. There is a lot of uncertainty which only causes more problems and separation. We do know, however, that living conditions are already worsening, and it does not seem as though businesses in the fossil fuel industry will be slowing down any time soon. In a blink of an eye, deadly heat waves will become the new norm. Air conditioning will only help those who can afford it, but it will also add to the ongoing carbon problem. Heat is already killing us, and our air is slowly becoming unbreathable. An increase in pollution has the capability to shorten life spans by 10 years. I don’t understand how civilizations and primarily their leaders are not more scared. I don’t believe that fear among the masses is not enough. 
  <br><br>
Unfortunately, we have to rely on those in power to make institutional change that will benefit us all. As David explained in the article, there are two opposing cultures: those who think we can fix the problem at hand and those who either don’t believe in or care about global warming. I admire David’s writing and think that his perspective is important. He paints an easy to understand picture of where the planet is currently heading. More people need to wake up! The title “Unbreathable air” really struck me, and I plan on sending this article to friends and family so that they can be triggered into action just like me.

<p>
"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells brought up a lot of interesting and thought-provoking events and possibilities that I had never considered to be direct consequences of the climate crisis. The vast majority of people's knowledge with regard to the climate crisis is limited to the rising of sea levels and to the extinction of marine life across the globe, myself included. I had never once correlated the rising temperatures and increase of greenhouse gases on our planet to the uninhabitable surface of Venus, despite reading a few fiction novels that used Venus' setting as a conduit for conflict. This is especially intriguing when Jim Hansen's background as a climatologist is being discussed, in which Wells states "Hansen began his career studying Venus.. wondering why he should be squinting across the solar system to explore rapid environmental change when he could see it all around him on the planet he was standing on.". The idea of our Earth becoming more and more like Venus is terrifying at best.
  <br><br>

Despite the above, Wells' alarmist stance does not petrify me, but instead motivates me to try and find solutions to help mitigate my contribution to climate change. I do not think I am alone in this either. While some might find Wells' article to be debilitating, most sound-minded people would interpret this to be a 'call to action' of some sort. In fact, one might say that Wells' article has the ability to motivate those who are complacent with the effects of climate change to wake up and change both their mindset, and habits.

David Wallace-Wells’ article “The Unhabitable Earth” is what some would argue an overdramatized version of a “temperature rise” on earth. Wallace-Wells does an exceptional job explaining the bigger picture, however, depicting what is happening because of climate change, and more importantly, the definite reality our world could become. This includes economic downfall, an increase in diseases, starvation, unbreathable air, and other extremely terrifying circumstances. Through scientific research and facts we know today to be true, he illustrates how the beautiful world as we know it is coming to an end faster than we’re trying to save it.
     <br><br>
     I think Wallace-Wells’ fear-appeal in his article isn’t because he is an “alarmist” or “overdramatized,” but is warning the public. He, like many others, has faced the facts. He understands climate change is real; it’s here; and it’s growing—fast. His article is an attempt at scaring people into action, for we’ve seen how simply informing is not doing enough. I felt a weight on my chest after reading his article: an unsettling feeling, weighed down by guilt to do better. It is only my expectation that after reading Wallace-Wells’ article and picturing what could soon be our world, others would feel the same.

<p>
“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells startled me into wanting to take action as I did not realize the severity of the climate change before reading the article. However, I do not believe that he is an alarmist as he is not exaggerating the dangers of people’s current actions. Instead, he simply presents the current information about the Earth’s condition and the consequences in the future if people’s actions do not change. The fear that the article evokes may motivate the reader to become self-aware of his or her actions concerning the earth as it definitely made me ponder about how my actions affect the environment. Therefore, I do wish he included actions that will help decelerate our carbon consumption.
     <br><br>

I found unbreathable air to be the most compelling consequence of climate change that is mentioned in the article. Because breathing occurs without a person’s conscious effort, people usually take this vital action that is necessary for human life for granted. Therefore, it worries me to know that “by 2090, as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the WHO ‘safe’ level.” Although unbreathable air may be the consequence that grab my attention the most while I was reading, all of the consequences mentioned in the article are equally frightening and fully convinced me to help change the course that the Earth is heading to if we do not change our carbon consumption.

<p>
Upon reading the " The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, it challenged me to think past the present and in to the future. Thinking of the future in a way I rarely do. Thinking about how the world is currently and how this will shape the future of our planet. This is not a thought that I think about much. However, what Wells' has done, is descriptively painted an image of Earth's future with facts that cannot be disputed. The importance of this article is bring into contrast what will happen to Earth if we keep things up the way they are. The first part of the Article 'Doomsday' which talked about melting icecaps honestly scared me, as professor Hiltner described in lecture the more carbon released will not be good for the atmosphere. Another part of the Article, 'The End of Food' Wallace-Wells' describes the crisis we will end up in if the world as a whole does not begin to make some changes. All these things described in the article I can say moved me. 
     <br><br>
How little thought I've given to the planet and how it can turn out to be is a big deal; I know I've been reluctant to think about this stuff and that right there is a big problem. This article really changed my perspective on climate change and I hope more people will come across this or at least something like this to help make them aware.



</p><hr>


<p>
While reading this article I knew about some of the topics already that were initially introduced, like the planet warming up at alarming rates or how the ozone layer cannot compensate for the excessive amount of greenhouse gases be released by anthropogenic activity. But what surprised me was how deep Wallace-Wells dove into the subject matter with ideas I've never considered before. The fact that with the permafrost melting there is a possibility of carbon evaporating as methane which is obviously very alarming as it's more powerful than carbon dioxide but also there's a possibility that the ice in the Arctic carries diseases that can be reanimated when unfrozen, so there being another plague brewing makes me wonder why this isn't being talked about more because I never knew about this. The concern of rising sea levels is only the tip of the iceberg (excuse the possible pun), but there truly is more going on than the general public has been made aware of, but there isn't necessarily all blame to put on the media or government as people can tend to live obliviously. Although the government isn't really taking a stance on protecting the kids which are our future since the wellbeing of the planet takes no priority.

     <br><br>

A known fact is that the change is gradual and also very dangerous, there hasn't been any real change implemented and the Paris Agreement wasn't enough. I'm very much concerned but not afraid or wanting to curl up in a ball and cry. Not all hope is lost and there is still hope, but the window of opportunity to help reverse or at least begin to repair the damage is closing. The potential lies within the people as we have the power to spread knowledge to get the message across, the message is that climate change is a global threat that can wipe out communities, destroy our oceans, and destroy life as we know it.



</p><hr>


<p>
I have read a fair amount of articles addressing climate change before, as well as a few videos too. Before reading this article, I was not aware of every detail climate change would affect. Yes, I knew to what extent it would affect us, but I was not aware of every nook and cranny it will weasel itself into-- and this article opened my eyes to a lot of that. Wells is right, I am barely scratching the surface. The part of this article about "The End of Food" was very interesting to me. I already knew that drought was a large possibility, but seeing the numbers of population change versus food availability really opened my eyes. In fact, that goes for most of this article-- numbers really help me visualize things (and in this case, they scare me too). But it also reminded me that the rich will not be as affected as the poor, as they will be able to afford the high cost of obtaining enough food far longer than the average person can.
     <br><br>


I think that Wells has enough facts backing his argument (for example, the facts you mentioned at the end of the video) to justify his "alarmist" attitude and approach towards climate activism and education. If you're asking my opinion, I think we have taken the passive approach for too long. Scaring people into actively changing their lifestyles is necessary in this situation, especially since Walls emphasizes that we really do not have much time left. Some climate change deniers might feel very defensive after reading something like this, but stating facts is the least we can do on our part. After reading this article, I want to read more on the subject. I feel that to educate the masses we must first educate ourselves.



</p><hr>


<p>
There is nothing alarmist in stating the facts. If anything I appreciate these staggering numbers and statistics because otherwise transmitting the same story/message in a different way to explain an otherwise awful ending to life on our planet would have downplayed the severity of our footprint on the climate crisis. In addition, it has proven people easily retain information that is negative compared to positive, so it could be argued as well that he's writing was a stylistic choice to create a bigger impact on the reader. This makes it easier to remember that the melting permafrost is releasing methane into the atmosphere which is worse than the release of carbon dioxide. I don’t believe Wallace is trying to alarm us in the way many would think he is (to scare) but instead educate the masses with reliable sources that clearly indicate the existence of human involvement in climate change. It is a sad reality that we must come face to face with (which is what I think Wallace and many scientists are trying to get us to understand), but still it is easier for many to just turn the other way and ignore because ignorance is bliss right? It has been brought up multiple times about how scientists have miss calculated the severity of the planet warming/freezing; they never thought our existence would have been put at risk. And thus in a way, face the moral obligation of informing the public, whether it may scare them along the way, it's just the cold hard truth. I don’t think Wallace is trying to petrify the readers more like Wallace was trying to shame us, kind of like telling a misbehaving child that their actions have consequences and need to take responsibility for them.
     <br><br>
After reading the article, let’s be honest, I don't think any of y'all were feeling like you were The Shit, as a matter of fact I can conclude that after reading the article we all are a piece of shit (for the most part). It’s disheartening for sure and no one is denying we really messed up; but it is also important to realize that the ones most at fault here are those in power and the institutions at play that allow for such actions against our planet’s health to go unchecked. I personally will continue to do my part as a broke college student in the fight against big corporations and politicians.
     <br><br>

I think considering Climate change advocates/scientists as Climate Change alarmists is completely ignoring the whole point of the work that goes into these findings and research. This is dismissing what the actual articles speaks about. The research findings are all backed up by evidence and these "phenomenons" are occurring all around us. There is no motive to lie or frighten when the ultimate consequence is our inevitable death.These are literal facts, which is what skeptics always argue about not having them right? Well it is definitely interesting to see the shift in opinions in skeptics when the facts turn not favor arguments and now suddenly findings become untrustworthy with hidden differences.

<p>
David Wallace-Wells’ article “The Uninhabitable Earth” does not leave any space for undermining the gravity of the climate crisis. “Doomsday”, “Heat Death”, “Unbreathable Air”, “Poisoned Oceans”; the section headings alone instill a true sense of fear, destruction, and catastrophe, immediately depicting the severity of our future if we do not act fast. 
      <br><br>

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines alarmism as “the often unwarranted exciting of fears or warning of danger”. To regard Wallace-Wells as an alarmist would imply that his ideas are unjustified, which is scientifically unreasonable. The climate crisis is an alarming issue, which desperately needs to be recognized as one. Global warming and climate change in general are a much more alarming phenomenon than is perceived, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that we are truly doomed if we do not make drastic changes, and quickly. 
      <br><br>

We are all deeply connected to the earth. It is one thing that we unarguably share as human beings, and it is one thing that we are collectively destroying. There is no future to even begin to think about if we continue down the dark path that we are headed. 
      <br><br>

I can become vegan, vote for politicians who advocate for immediate and aggressive action, stop driving cars. However, if I was the only one to do this, not much would happen. A single person cannot change the fate of our entire planet. What we really need to do is change the world’s views, ideas, and actions. We have to take the initiative to not only alter our own ways of living, but to alter others’ misconstrued perceptions. We must join forces and collaborate as one being in order to mitigate this crisis.

Before reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" I believed I had a good idea of how serious climate change was. I was extremely surprised how much my views have been changed after the reading. I believed that it wouldn't be my generation or even my kids generation that would see the devastating effects of climate change. But even in the first section, "Doomsday", David  Wallace-Wells he has convinced me that I will see the devastating effects in my lifetime and it is happening much faster than I anticipated. In the third section, "The End of Food", I was able to better understand how not only climate change will effect our agricultural food supply but that it will also greatly affect our livestock supply. Also, I better understand now how over populated we are and how this will effect our food supply as well. With a combination of heat, drought and over population, I now see why we have to take action now.

<p>
The article, "The Uninhabitable Earth" was very properly crafted in a way that it made everybody who read it feel as though climate change is a pressing matter. There are a lot of calls to action when it comes to climate change, however it feels as though we have time and that me slowly easing into a plant based diet is the way to go. This article can primarily be described with the term chaotic, but somehow it feels as thought that's the manner of urgency we should all carry when dealing with climate change as a whole. I thought more than anything, it was interesting that Wallace mentioned the scientists who were too afraid to face the problem head on and now it's too late to even avoid the first "worst case scenario." At this point we will be lucky if the world starts cooling after we increase the temperature by 2 degrees. I think that the article definitely had sentiments that made me feel as though any form of salvation from this rapidly warming planet was close to impossible, however I think that some people need to feel that way in order to make any sort of change.
      <br><br>
I even sent this article to my parents, who were shocked that something which is not as pressing in the media would be affecting places they'd visited and lived their lives in for decades. It disappoints me that so many large corporations and millionaires continue to take advantage of the freedom that we have with our emissions, and especially the fact that Donald Trump has decided to not take part in any sort of agreement to lower the United States' gaping carbon footprint. Wallace's approach was something I respected within this article because there was no sugar coating, something that citizens of wealthy countries need to understand.



</p><hr>


<p>
After reading this article, I was amazed by some of the power of possible devastating conditions. For example, the melting of Arctic permafrost may contribute to powerful and harmful emissions that even encourage ancient plagues. As the global temperature keeps increasing, more diseases stored in ice, and more parasites tend to survive. Livings on earth are exposed to those threats, which may result in death or severe illness. Besides, due to the unbreathable air and extreme heat, chronic kidney disease and respiratory disease could be some health concerns. Additionally, food shortage, drought, ocean acidifications, and more frequent tsunamis will all impact our lives more directly and significantly. 
      <br><br>




Not only just humans are affected by climate change, but also animals. They suffer to find food or survive due to climate change effects. We are currently in the Sixth mass extinction, and while some of the scientists remain positive that technology will get us out of the problem, some other scientists believe that keeping the rising temperature below 2 degrees can no longer solve the problem. Therefore, we should begin to at least change our lifestyle and gather people together to fight for environmental campaigns. However, communication and conveying the message effectively has always been a problem for environmental issues. There are still many people denying anthropocentric climate change, which requires a lot of effort to communicate with the public efficiently.

<p>
After reading the "The Uninhabitable Earth," I learned so many things about climate change that I wish I knew beforehand. Before, I used to think that climate change does exist but sometimes was exaggerated all over media and scientific articles. However, after realizing my pretentiousness and abandoning such negativity for this course, I'm glad that I was able to learn that climate change is happening in such a drastic rate because it is an issue that the public in general must know about. There are many things that they should know in order to help the planet, which is all of our homes. 
      <br><br>

David Wallace-Wells reminds all of the readers to make sure to think about the future of the human beings, and other living things. It gives an alarming provocation that helps the audience to realize that we shouldn't ignore the issue and face the reality hand in hand. For example, the author mentions about the possible future for Bangladesh and Miami. The fact that those two areas can be flooded to death is very horrifying, and if humans continue to ignore the harsh reality and future, then there will be consequence that we all must face. Therefore, we all should unite and act on this problem together now when we can, rather than continuing to deem this phenomenon as fake and irrelevant.



</p><hr>


<p>
After reading "The Uninhabited Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I will never call him alarmist again. The fact is that all of these disasters he pointed out have been scientifically proven that disasters that bring us climate change at the current rate will happen in the future. This video reminds me of the lesson: How can an animal survive if it cannot adapt to the harsh environment? 1. Migration. 2. Evolution. 3. Die. Humans are just like animals. In fact, there are only three options: 1. Migration (it is impossible to find a new planet to live in) and 2. Evolution (AI may replace humans but that is a new one Specie) 3 dead (currently the only option humans can do). We are no different from animals in the face of natural disasters, and we will also perish when the earth is no longer habitable, just late or early. When I heard that the lungs of the earth (Amazon Forest) were burning, when I heard that wildfires in Australia had been burning for four months, when I heard the fire in California, I felt distressed and powerless.
      <br><br>
I hope that the government and factories can take a long-term view in the face of huge short-term benefits.  Maybe we people should take a longer-term view and vote for the long-term politicians instead of just looking at short-term achievements.

<p>
While reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, it made me realize the impact of climate change on a variety of things. I generally knew that there would be negative impacts on economic systems, food scarcity, and global temperatures. However, I did not realize that our health could potentially be at risk through old diseases making a comeback due to permafrost melting. It made me realize that most of us are unaware of how the smallest of things can make a large impact or have a chain reaction. When I used to thing of ice melting, I thought it would just lead to sea levels rising because that is mainly what the media had emphasized on. Never had I really focused on what other underlying effects the melting of ice could lead to. This is why even though Wallace-Wells seemed to write the article in a more alarmist approach, I felt it was effective in making the reader more aware of issues. It helped create a sense of urgency about the issues we are facing and making us realize that we no longer have the luxury of time to fix things. Normally people assume that we either have a plenty of time to reverse our damage or don't believe that we are in a "bad" position yet. However, Wallace-Wells helps show how one climate change event can have a large chain reaction on the global scale.

I took this article so seriously that I started telling my friends to not have children because their kids would live in horrible conditions! I’m an optimistic person but I lack faith in humanity because most people know we’re in a climate crisis but they take it as a joke or brush it off as if it weren’t happening already. I enjoyed how blunt Wallace Wells was because I felt that more of his language should be used, people need to be scared and need to know just how bad it can get. People only tend to care for things when they’re close to gone and since people haven’t seen something bad happen to THEM yet, they need to at least hear what could happen if we all don’t get on the same boat. It’s not enough to rely on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we all have to change our behavior like how much and what we eat and buy. We need to change the culture we grew up in where we want more, it’s not our fault, we were always offered many options of many things because we live in a capitalist society but we need to start CONSUME LESS of everything!

      <br><br>

I thought all the possibilities Wallace-Wells suggested are very realistic, I’m kinda scared that his timing will be off and instead of things truly going to hell in 2100 like the article mentioned, they end up happening sooner. I think whenever it does happen people are bound to get chaotic once there’s no food, scarce shelter, plagues, and an intense heat. Especially if carbon reaches 1000ppm and humans cognitive ability declines by 21% like Wallace says. I think that was an interesting point to make because he didn’t elaborate on what that means but I interpreted as people aren’t going to think or function properly, I don’t know if that means they’ll go crazy but they definitely are going to struggle to survive, they already will be struggling but I guess what I’m saying is there’ll be no “survival of the fittest” here because everyone will be at the same or maybe even lower thinking level (unable to analyze and think strategically to try and survive).

      <br><br>

This might be too extreme of a proposal but I always thought it would be smart to encourage families to adopt in order to control or slow down population levels but that would be something that A LOT of families would have to do and I understand that people want to have children of their own blood but honestly why make MORE kids suffer.

After reading the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” by David Wallace-Wells, my fears for the changing earth only became further solidified with his morbid facts in which he portrays the many ways humans have hurt the environment, and the countless catastrophic events that will result. He speaks with great urgency, using what I would call a successful alarmist tone. I believe that, although harsh, his tone is exactly what the article needs to get the point across that we must act. 
      <br><br>

Personally, after reading the article, I felt like I needed to take action, and I wish this could be true for everyone. I unfortunately believe that because there may be a stigma against “climate change alarmists,” he may be easily dismissed or perceived as crazy by some. It did surprise me, however, that he later released work on how it wasn’t quite as urgent as he once thought. This could make him seem less credible. However, the facts and statistics he incorporates into his work are necessary, meaningful, and astonishing. For example, Wallace-Wells states, “At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today.” This is inarguable and will be catastrophic when the sea level rises. 
      <br><br>

In addition, his section, “Climate Plagues,” resonated with me the most because of the heartbreaking yet terrifying fact that “a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax” when a bacteria infected carcass held in permafrost from 75 years prioir was exposed. This section was most compelling to me because it is filled with information I wouldn’t believe if I was told by anyone but a scientist. The fact that these trapped diseases will come out of the thawed ice and cause harm terrifies me. Overall, the article made me feel very emotional, but in a way that made me want to take action, so I am thankful to have read it.

After reading David Wallace-Wells', "The Uninhabitable Earth," I believe that his alarmist statements are reasonable when you take into consideration his passion and drive to change the future of our planet before it's too late. In my opinion, it was Wells' intention to make his article as fear-inducing as possible to get his message across to readers effectively without taking away from the gravity of the situation and to hold the audience's attention for longer. By creating some fear on the subject matter, he is attempting to kick-start some action among his reader to push for change. For example, he conveys how Bangladesh has little chance of survival in the near future, as a result of climate change. By utilizing examples, Wells' adds to the significance of the unnatural course we've set Earth on. In general, the author's article is an amazing piece of scientific literature and provides reader with magnitude of the problem we've put ourselves.

In his article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” Wallace-Wells takes on an extremely necessary alarmist approach to climate change despite being at risk of alienating some of his readers. After hearing the same warning for years that the earth is warming up at an alarming rate, I believe we have become desensitized to the danger of it. Therefore, Wallace-Wells alarmist approach is necessary in informing the general public of the dangerous reality that is climate change and persuading them to do something about it. With his list of specific consequences, Wallace-Wells attempts to invoke fear in his audience. I believe it is the combination of consequences rather than one in specific that effectively acts as a call to action.

I like to believe that I am well informed on the climate crisis and doing my part to relieve it. However, this alarming article has unfortunately proven me otherwise. I believe we’re naturally inclined to believe studies that tell us climate change really isn’t as bad as it is being portrayed. We don’t want it to be a reality, but it already is. It’s important for us to understand it is always much worse than we think it is. Like the first part of the article claims, a lot of us are focused on the rising sea levels and disappearing coastlines. While this is a severe aspect of climate change, the melting of permafrost was incredibly surprising and terrifying to hear. This was an effect that I wasn’t aware of yet, and it’s severity is much more than I could have ever imagined. The danger of such a large amount of carbon dioxide being released as methane into the atmosphere is almost incomprehensible. Furthermore, the similarities between past mass extinctions and today’s climate crisis are striking. I have some knowledge of the role of green house gases in previous mass extinctions, but it was never really struck me that the same is happening right before our eyes.
      <br><br>

In general, the effects of climate change are something we don’t consider enough. For example, the rise in temperature might seem gradual to us, but it is indeed frighteningly quick. It is scary to think that people in my lifetime will have to face the increasing challenges of climate change on a day to day basis. Although the effects of climate change will not hit all at once, we will have to endure the journey there. This article was necessarily overwhelming, given that the majority of us need a wake up call. Climate change is not simply going to go away, and altering small aspects of our life is not going to be enough. We need to completely restructure our way of life and thinking if there is ever going to be hope for the planet.

David Wallace-Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth" is to be regarded as a resource for informing the masses about the very real consequences we face as a result of global climate change.  Wallace-Wells effectively outlines and describes in great detail the different outcomes that will follow like an unbreathable atmosphere, perpetual war among nations, and a permanent economic collapse brought on by reduced global output.  Although the picture Wallace-Wells depicts for our earth is deeply concerning and more than a little bleak, it absolutely necessary to be transparent about the issues that will directly effect us as a society. If not now, then in the near future, if we mean to make well-informed decisions about making changes in policy and legislation regarding our environment or smarter choices in our day-to-day lives.  The criticism of Wallace-Wells' "alarmist" position is to be rejected.  The issue of global climate change is extremely severe and should be treated with equal severity and the utmost attention to further developments; we can no longer be naive or dismissive of the matter.

While reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I began to appreciate the alarmism he wrote with. Instead of giving readers the “common” or “quick little reminder” in regards to climate change, he does not hesitate to scare the reader. David goes above and beyond the average climate crisis article. Not only does he provide specific effects beyond the typical “rising sea-levels”, but he also provides smaller examples of these large problems that are happening as we speak on a lower scale. All of them are terrible, to say the least. 

      <br><br>



It wasn’t until I read this article that I learned about the pocket of methane gas trapped in arctic ice that is waiting to be released. Not only was I unaware of that, but also the fact it would equate to eighty-six times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a two-decade period. In addition to warming power, he effectively draws on current examples like death due to heat exposure in El Salvador; one-fifth of the men working the fields, that once used to be workable, have kidney failure related problems due to the dehydration caused by the heat.

I was definitely shaken by David Wallace-Well's article. I haven't had time to deeply think about the effects of global warming around the world and how detrimental it would be in absolutely all aspects of the world. As he mentions in the article, many climate deniers simply push aside global warming saying that it won't affect the world as much as everyone says, this is belief is partly due to the fact that global warming is so hard to understand with all the abstract data that is being thrown around. Even though I have always believed in global warming, the abstract, huge scope, and slow effects changed how I thought about the climate crisis. After reading some of the comments, many people believe that this article is begrudgingly long. However, I believe there was no other way to organize this article. Wallace-Wells cleanly lays out each effect of global warming that we can accurately see right now, with scientists' quotes and findings. There is no other more straight forward way to do this. Along with this, the length of the article gave me more time to think about these effects and change my view.  

      <br><br>

Some more specific aspects that I enjoyed about the article was the effects that I would have never been able to connect to global warming. When thinking about global warming many people just think about desertification and sea level rising. Reading about how much the economy would be affected, the air pollution. the violence that would ensue, and climate plagues that would spread pushed my fear and want to act even more than the obvious first-hand effects.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” written by David Wallace-Wells is an alarming article that showcases 9 consequences that our world will suffer from if climate change, directly reflected by the rise of global temperature, keeps happening. I’ve never read an article that’s more profound than this and the masterpiece by David Wallace-Wells was unprecedented in the way of unveiling the cruel reality of the climate crisis and elaborating it into comprehensive details. Before reading the article, I recognized that climate change is an urgent problem for all humans to solve and I did not expect this article would heighten my perception of the climate crisis to another level. However, without any exaggeration, I found myself in an entirely new world of our situation. Throughout the whole article, the author seems to frighten readers by just simply throwing out facts and facts that brought me into consideration, but later I found out that this was just the major strategy that the author uses to warn his readers. Like the fifth part of his article, “Unbreathable Air”, the author was just straight-up offering a variety of data including the number of people who died because of the air problem caused by the increasing amount of greenhouse gases generated. At the very first glance, these data wouldn’t give that much shock to readers. But, when we read along, those numbers will keep repeating in our heads and finally we will realize that we could have been the people who died in those disasters. Isn’t that scary, devastating, and dreadful? At least I thought it was. In the aspect of awakening and enlightening people into the reality of climate change, this article couldn’t be better. Last but not least, Ken mentions seven things; the anxiety keeps filling my brain as those seven things are coming out. The severity of our climate crisis really gets me thinking. Even a moment cannot be delayed. We must find a way out.

David Wallace-Wells is definitely not an alarmist. The evidence of current climate change and the potential consequences are undeniable. I suppose he did use some sensational appeal to the general public but overall the article doesn’t overestimate the possible end of our future.
        <br><br>
   I have watched many videos on climate changes prior to this class, and I have seen many kinds of reactions to climate change: some people felt overwhelmed, some people accepted their fate, some people however chose to deny such a reality. I myself felt numb to the ongoing climate change before and I think there are many reasons why I didn’t feel like climate change is such a big deal. When I got to know climate change before I just knew that “oh temperature is going to rise I suppose”, “guess I will miss winter”, “when will I get to see the climate change start taking action?”. Many people who deny climate change claim that since the Earth has gone through climate changes before so this time would be the same. No one listed out the many serious consequences that come with climate change, and stressed how rapid it is that it throws the natural adaptation out of the rail. All of these make me appreciate The Uninhabitable Earth more because how he lists this large amount of evidence in an organized form so people could start understanding the situation and making small changes to their life, hoping that we can make it through in the end.

In 2014, when Interstellar came out starring Matthew Mcconaughey, I enjoyed it. I thought it was a cool science fiction story that offered some interesting perspectives on human life and our push to survive. Little did I know that years later I would feel as though my future may end up being the beginning of that story. In it, the planet is dying, the only food available is corn, the weather patterns of the world are insane, and there is nothing that the people of Earth could do to save their home. After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I learned that we are not to far away from this future if something is not immediately done, and even then we may be too late.
        <br><br>


No other article that I have read concerning the climate crisis has been nearly as blunt as this one. Wells did no sugarcoating, no hiding, no saving the readers' feelings whatsoever. Every single detail about how the world is going to die was listed in exquisite detail. In other articles and climate-addressing media, there is very much an element of hope, an idea that everything can still be saved. I think that is a toxic idea, as it helps us ignore the pressing issue. It gives us an idea that we can wait, that nothing is actually super pressing. This article presents another idea, that we need to hurry. We need to take action. David Wallace Wells has the right idea, and we can only hope that more people read this and also realize how pressing this is.

Climate change is a topic which has greatly concerned me since I first learned about the drastic implications it will have on our earth in my high school environmental science class. Although I have been cognizant of the effects of climate change for a while now, it wasn’t until I read David Wallace-Wells’s article, "The Uninhabitable Earth," that I was able to truly understand just how fast our earth is changing because of anthropogenic CO2 and methane emissions.
        <br><br>


I believe that his alarmist approach was necessary for both the informed and the uninformed to fully grasp what might happen if we do not take immediate action in the fight against climate change. With the scare factor implemented in his article, he grabs the attention of readers and captivates them by laying out effects of climate change that could directly impact their lives. For example, under the section titled ‘Unbreathable Air,’ Wells states that human cognitive ability declines as CO2 increases. By stating facts that directly affect everyone instead of listing off the typical climate change consequences such as rising oceans and ice caps melting, Wells gives readers in any part of the world a reason to fight against the destructive results of CO2 emissions.
        <br><br>


While the article was very strong, I believe it was lacking hopeful solutions for climate change and easy ways for people to get involved in the fight. If there had been solutions embedded within the article, I believe that more people would have found the article more helpful than frightening. On the other hand, it successfully conveys the seriousness of the situation which is what Wells said scientists are failing to do in the media as a result of climate change denialism. Wells sets an example for readers of how seriously we should be taking this issue which could lead to our civilizations ultimate demise.

I have read Wallis-Wells’ article, The Uninhabitable Earth, on a couple prior occasions, and I still think he does a good job of clearly describing plausible outcomes of the climate crisis on various fronts if we continue business as usual. Additionally, I don’t think it is appropriate to characterize much of this article as alarmist, because it is statistics and study heavy. Furthermore, I think its important how Wallis-Wells points out that many reports, including the IPCC reports are generally conservative, and the language used in climate science does not reflect the gravity of findings or our situation. Overall, I think The Uninhabitable Earth provides a descriptive and easy to understand outline of a set of complex potential projected outcomes of the climate crisis.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” is one of the most in-depth articles I have ever read on the issue of climate change. Although many articles are written about this topic, the author David Wallace-Wells takes on an alarmist approach to urge people to uncover the truth about climate change and how devastating the results would be if we don’t take action now. Wallace-Wells breaks down his article into ten sections which detail how climate change can affect various people in various situations, many of which I have never heard of. 
         <br><br>

Of all the sections that I have read, I found the “Climate Plagues” section the most intriguing. I found it to be fascinating because I have never heard that viruses and other illnesses can be trapped in the ice and as it melts, it can infect a multitude of people like it once had many years ago. Although in this day and age we have cures for many diseases and vaccinations, Wallace-Wells suggests that there may potentially be fatal diseases once they are rereleased due to the ice that encloses them is melted. An interesting fact that was in this section was that remnants of the 1918 flu infected 500 million+ people and killed 100 million+ people. If another disease like this would be released humans along with animals will not have the immune systems to fight off these ancient diseases. 
         <br><br>

This article opened my eyes to the different ways climate change is affecting the whole planet in many ways other than just heating it up. With this knowledge I hope to not only educate myself but others as well on the full extent of climate changes’ effects.

Before reading the "The Uninhabitable Earth" I didn't know much about how we were contributing to the climate crisis, only that we were doing something bad. However reading this article opened my eyes and  it made me realize that humans are basically feeding off the planet's natural resources and using them for our own profits like parasites. I felt bad but interested while reading this because I know that a single person can't change this problem by themselves, however if people were to switch their ways and maybe come together to fight big oil companies and those other companies that play huge roles in carbon emissions then we might have an actual chance to live on this planet still. I feel that all I can do as of now is switch to renewable resources and reduce my carbon footprint and inform others of what is going on around us.
         <br><br>
I think the alarmist tactic is a great way to get readers to open their eyes and to encourage them to act. Climate change is real however it is slow and takes place over time that is why there are many skeptics, however when it comes to straight facts they can't argue against it without sounding idiotic and redundant. I thought the most compelling part of the article was the climate plague section because it's scary to think that what killed many people in the past is literally frozen right beneath us and will come out if temperatures keep rising. I am not looking forward to that.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” is indeed an exhausting article to finish. Not only on the length of it but also because the numerous unsettling results of anthropogenic climate change depicted by Wallace-Wells. The whole article is broken into nine sections, introducing almost every aspect of the negative influence of climate change, such as economy, warfare, famine etc. Although I had already taken one environmental course last quarter and had watched many documentary films and arguments, Wallace-Wells still manages to give me something new. What he takes on the discovery and utilization of fossil fuels is pretty simple yet thorough. Fossil fuels can not get away with the reason why what humanity has done to mother earth took a sudden deterioration in recent decades. Although it is proven to be one leading source of carbon emission, how today’s economy structures does not allow environmentalists to make progress. Those in power fights only for profits and that creates a vicious spiral in climate change. 
         <br><br>
However, reading along the article, I find many of Wallace-Wells’ argument does not stand strong. He attempts to cover all aspects of climate change but sometimes he just seems desperate and trying too hard to prove he’s right. Especially in the part he talks about how rising temperature affects people’s temper and causes a raise in war. He simply claims that there is a straight relationship between those two factors. In reality, war is with no doubt a complicated code to break. Similar cases happens along his argument from now and then and that is what makes me critical.

Before reading “The uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I never think about how global warming would have negative influence on daily life. Although scientists do claim that it is important to protect our environment, people care less about this issue. But the environment problem do become worse and worse these year which it cause some irreversible results. The glacier is melting and the sea level is rising. After reading the article, I felt shocked that this is a extremely serious problem that people should all pay attention to. With global warming, there are serious consequences in many places. The damage causes are worse than people thought. Although government do put some policies which seem to protect the environment, the effects are little because people do not take part in. The disasters are terrible. So, the article persuades everyone to take efforts to make our environments do to be worse. People used to think that there behavior would not damage the whole environment. However, people all over the world do have a great effect on global environment. Although the scientists do not come up a perfect idea to solve the problem, we could do something which is easy to do in our life to improve the situation.

This article contained a lot of striking information. One of the things that stuck out to me was that by 2050, 5 billion people would have to reckon with malaria due to it being able to multiply faster in warmer conditions. To think that malaria could be knocking on your doorstep is a scary thought, and that’s only the beginning of the problems. With the rise of temperatures, food growth would optimize to different locations while being barren in the original locations of the world. Places where civilizations once flourished and were birthed, where agricultural societies were birthed would need to move to other places around the world. By 2100 human cognitive ability will decline 21 percent. So if we’re not able to solve the problem now, it will probably be a lot harder to solve the problem then. And if were unable to solve this problem to due our brain function decreasing, the coral and life in the ocean will be unable to flourish and will result in a decrease in diversity if not life all together.

After reading the article, I can see how a person can walk away scared. To me, I liked that Wallace-Wells was straight forward. I was able to understand the article thanks to his comparisons like the animals/engines simile. I was aware climate change but it is difficult to follow the updates because mainstream news outlets like CNN and MSNBC do not cover the topic the right way. Those news outlets treat climate change like it is a debate when it is not. It is already happening and the government is not taking action. 

         <br><br>

This article laid out predictions and that is an angle of the climate change discourse that I do not hear enough. I am glad that he included those predictions because I believe that it will spark something in the reader. It definitely sparked me. To the point about Wallace-Wells being alarmist, I believe it is the right approach. If this country takes strong action, more lives on this plancet could be saved.

The title of the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, sounds scary and makes people feel anxious and upset that someday the environment on the earth will no longer be inhabitable for all living things, including human beings. Unfortunately, the information shows in the article suggests that the title is not made up by the author to simply attract more people to read it, but instead, people are actually facing the environmental crisis like global warming that would possibly cause the earth to become uninhabitable. 
         <br><br>

In recent years, environmental crisis become very popular topics. I learn about global warming, greenhouse gas, carbon emissions, resources shortage, and the side effects that comes along with those issues. I know global warming will cause the rise of sea level that would directly affect thousands of people’s lives near the coasts. However, even though I know about those facts, it is hard for me to understand the urgency of stopping greenhouse gas emissions. In the article, it talks about that it would be highly possible for the earth to reach two degrees of warming within 20 years, which is used to be seen as a very dangerous assumption. For me, the acceleration of global warming is a little out of control, and when the issue is irreversible, it is hard to imagine what life would be after a few decades. And then it mentions that the previous mass extinctions were all caused by climate change due to greenhouse gas. Again, it shows that everyone on the planet should take actions as soon as possible to slow down the global warming, if we do not want to experience the mass extinction.

The reading for this week, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” did an efficient job at increasing my concern for the planet and humanity going forward, and it was already quite high to begin with. For my response I have pulled  a few quotes from the article that alarmed me. From the “Doomsday” portion: “we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.” This statistic is a little daunting, and also exhibits the power Earth contains. From “The End of Food”: “if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them.” This quote is quite alarming as well, and something that isn’t being considered by many people today. The projection of mouths to feed and food to feed them doesn’t look good going forward. The last quote is from “Unbreathable Air”: “Already, more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning; each year, 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season.” I was unaware that the numbers of death due to pollution were this high already. It will be shocking and frustrating to watch those numbers increase in the future.



</p><hr>


<p>
"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells brings awareness to different issues that impact the Earth. With doomsday, if the Arctic permafrost thaws then “carbon may evaporate as methane” which is worse for the environment than CO2. There are different aspects, but the one I fear the most is temperatures rising which causes deaths at a rapid amount. Although it is not as catastrophic as hurricanes or any natural disaster, it would cause rapid deaths for those who cannot handle the heat, from babies to older people. In a way I felt that he was a bit comedic as he made a comment in regards to heat death as he mentioned that turning on the air conditioning would help but the CO2 gases would raise. This appealed to me and made it more of a peace that is easier to connect to. 

         <br><br>

In terms of pollution, I agree with his statements and understand where he is coming from based on the scientific facts. I would want my children to be able to live a happy adequate life without having to have many different factors of medical issues. The cost of living is already high and we would just be adding to it if we do not make the right changes in the environment.

<p>
As I clicked on the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I was fully prepared to find myself discovering new facts about our Earth but my mind was absolutely blown by the amount of things going on around the world that I had no idea about. The fact that most of the consequences of climate change are not even general knowledge or taught in school is astonishing because we should be trying to educate each other of just how much our planet is suffering. Even from the first part titled “Doomsday” I knew that I did not know enough. Of course when climate change is talked about, most people throw out statistics because they are one of the most useful tools in the sense that they have a logical approach to the subject, but in this section the statistics are used in such a way that it makes us, the reader, want to reevaluate the way we are living on this planet. Even a developed nation such as the United States is at risk of losing Miami, Florida in the next decade as a result of our rapid climate change growth. But that is not all, there are several places around the globe that will be lost whether it is caused by floods or droughts or temperature rise, hence “The Uninhabitable Earth.” He goes into depth about how the consequences of climate change could be creating even worse scenarios such as when he states how the Arctic permafrost holds 1.8 trillion tons of CO2 and the permafrost is melting which is causing the “release date” of that CO2 to continue to move up. 
         <br><br>

I think this article is more effective and opens the eyes of my generation because unlike other films and articles on climate change, it is very blunt in what is going to happen if we continue living like this. Wallace-Wells uses fear to alarm us. The really scary part about it is that he uses facts to inflict the fear among us. He talks about how bad the future could be/ might be if we don’t do anything to change it. David Wallace-Wells uses this approach in hopes that our generation will step up and try to fight climate change because we are fearful of what our Earth will become if we don’t. As readers we are alarmed by statements such as the fact that a previous mass extinction was brought on by similar events, the temperature rising just a few degrees and most of us want to do something to change it. Invoking fear upon the reader is an interesting approach, and as long as it is making the reader learn more about this subject, I would say it is very effective.

While perusing “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I was surprisingly forced to look at every aspect of climate change and its effects on every part of the world as we know it now. Though the article carried an overall detrimental tone I think the consistency of facts about our destructive reality is crucial to the impact on the reader. Talk of inescapable ramifications that will ultimately lead to death in every sphere politically, ecologically, and economically brings a serious sense of alarm that most climate change articles and propaganda don’t allow. Usually when hearing about climate change, serious facts may be presented but in a way that eventually brushes off an apocalyptic resolution as if mankind will save the planet at the very last second. Knowing numbers about population wiping diseases that can spread and the intensity to which we are killing the planet in comparison to previous rates, speaks on a different level that I feel could push more people to try to make a change or at least understand to an extent the seriousness of climate change and our future.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I found it to be quite shocking the extent of how serious the issue of climate change is. I did know before reading the article that the climate crisis is a very dangerous occurrence, but David Wallace-Wells brings up many different points of views that had not even crossed my mind before reading the article. I particularly found the climate plagues section (the fourth section of the article) most interesting because, as a biology major, it really shocked me as to how dangerous new diseases may be. I never really thought about what could occur if new diseases, and bugs, suddenly come back to life. It almost seems impossible for it to happen, as if it was out of a science fiction book, but David Wallace-Wells makes it a good point in how dangerous it could be. Obviously diseases even now are frightening, but the fact that we will potentially be exposed to even worse viruses and plagues suddenly, with no known cure, treatment, or general information about it, could be life threatening, especially because diseases are especially dangerous for children and the elderly. Diseases from melting ice caps are just one of the threats that he mentions that most people would not think about as an issue when thinking about climate change. 
         <br><br>


As far as his overall viewpoint, even though he does take an alarmist point of view, I feel that his worry is valid. I also think he does a good job in helping readers not only understand the seriousness of the issue, but really help the reader think about how their own actions can lead to, essentially, the end of the world. He focuses on the future and what the world could eventually look like if we do not make a change. I feel that this could encourage more people to want to make a difference to prevent the disaster that will lie ahead.

Prior to attending any lecture for ENG 23 or reading any course material, I truthfully knew very little about climate change. I knew the Earth was getting warmer, but after reading “The Uninhabitable Earth,” it is clear how our current crisis is much more than that. My knowledge of climate change came from articles I would read regarding the given month’s current climate tragedy. For example, the end of December to now seems to be Australia. While being captivated and scared by all the facts David Wallace-Wells presented, I found the most alarming fact was we are releasing more carbon at a rate much faster than what started the Triassic-Jurassic extinction. That fact paired with Wallace’s harsh reality that “No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster” undoubtedly makes me feel helpless. After reading this piece I feel completely vulnerable to the near sixth extinction we have summoned.
         <br><br>

Relating to my immediate feeling of helplessness after reading Wallace’s piece, I do find the article to be a bit alarmist. However, I find the alarming nature of this piece to be much needed given there are people who do not know much about climate and some who deny it. Aside from my opinion on the alarming nature of the piece, I found the most compelling consequence that Wallace lays out to be the “Unbreathable Air.” I found it the most compelling because China experienced the harsh reality of having unbreathable air at the result of climate change in 2013.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace, it made me realize how much my perception of the severity of climate change has been influenced by scientific reticence. I knew the problem was bad but the severity outlined in the article was shocking. I believe the fact that scientists do not emphasize the severity of this crisis is contributing to how many people view climate change.
          <br><br>
Many people view climate change as a distant issue or as something that will affect other people, but not them. Wallace discusses how if climate change continues down the path it is on, it will negatively impact everyone on the planet. Food supplies and agriculture will be destroyed and will not be able to support our global population (not that it does now).

After reading the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I do feel anxiety of climate change. From many scientific predictions, we could know that lots of our daily activities would destroyed and worsen the earth and environment, which pose danger to our life. Like we are not able to live in an environment over 105 degrees Fahrenheit that is likely for us to experience in the future, or daily activities of people living in specific area  such as Mecca would be influenced because of heat stress, these are shocking our impression about climate change and improve out consciousness.  Also, other resources on the earth like forests, tundra, and ice are decreasing now, and some outcomes are frightening: exposing extremely destructive virus from many years ago which has killed human, let alone oceans and air that are closely related to our daily life.

The article surprised me in many ways throughout the read, making me realize more consequences that will occur due to climate change. From the plague to economic collapse, Wallace-Wells does show climate change to be the end of all. All these pessimistic information came to me all in shock, but I came to a consensus that humans will be able to find a chance to avoid these problems. I understand that the effect of climate change will be inevitable, but when people see explicit consequences, there will be a change. I think that there will be populations that will be hurt and lose so much due to climate change (such as sea level risings or unbreathable air). I don't think we will act efficiently on the matter until we get to that point. Wallace-Wells may alert of the danger in an alarmist manner, but nothing will happen until the consequences occur.

I believe Wallace-Wells effectively wrote about the potential dangers and damage that may ensue due to climate change in that the audience, after reading, will be left petrified at the current state of the world. But, this isn’t “Breaking News” to us; I learned in high school that rising sea levels will cause flooding or that fracking and mountain top destroy habitats for several animals and organisms. Wallace-Wells allows the audience to perceive the dangers of climate change by using the imaginative societies of post-apocalyptic movies such as Mad Max and zombie movies to illustrate an image of what Earth would look like in the near future. The author’s alarming tone throughout the article seems super pessimistic at the beginning about a long term life on Earth. It seems as if Wallace-Wells is going to continue on these endless facts of the Earth dying but he reassures the audience towards the end that we need to act now for change. What stood out to me throughout the whole article was the statistics of the number of people who died from the effects of climate change such as the “more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning; each year, 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season”. These numbers did not surprise me however it was my lack of knowledge that climate change affects humans directly and not just indirectly such as melting ice caps or rising sea levels. It was the first time that I had ever heard of something like this; never once did I see a news report from CNN, for example, stating the facts that every year (or day!) humans suffer and die due to hyperthermia or lung cancers or other causes. Part VII of the article also interested me because of the people who will be involved. Even if all the coal and oil resources are burned through completely, wouldn’t the “stable” global economy last for a couple of years before a devastating fall that would come from climate change? Even if burning through coal and oil brings a stable economy, there will not be another industry that can sustain through to help level and maintain the economy’s stabilization.

When reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells I felt a lot of emotions. One of the biggest things that moves me when Climate Change is discussed is what is going to happen to the animals. I'm a huge animal rights activist and whenever I see an article that shows the dreadful impact humans are doing to poor helpless animals I am immediately felt with sadness. In “The Uninhabitable Earth” when it discussed the “Poisoned Oceans” and how they will become acidified which will result in the death of countless fish all I could think of was how those fish didn't do anything wrong to merit their death. The whole article is as depressing as scary as one can be and I fully agree with this approach. Most individuals nowadays don't realize the gravity of the situation, including myself and this puts it into terms we can all understand. The scariest portions of this was how the air won't be breathable anymore and how we’ll run out of food. 
          <br><br>

There are plenty of people that believe the earth is always changing and use ice ages as “evidence” but to simply ignore the effects humans are doing is utter ridiculous. This article pinpoints direct results of what happens when humans are greedy. If there is no change done then all of the incredibly scary events in this article will come true. We need to start somewhere and the best time to worry about climate change was 100 years ago but the second best time is today.

In the article "The Uninhabitable Earth," by David Wallace-Well the consequences of the real effects of climate change are taken to a new deeper level. For those of us who believe in the severity of the climate crisis, most of us do not adequately understand the real effects that the crisis if not prevented will have on our planet. The majority of the population who do believe in the severity of the climate crisis only realize the bare minimum of how real the effects are. We believe the planet's temperatures are rising and we know this is bad and will have undesirable consequences to this country, but we truly are not quite sure what those really are. The author David Wallace-Well of the article does a great job explaining the severity and seriousness of what will truly happen if we don't prevent this crisis from progressing. I believe the author's of giving in-depth details of what will truly happen is effective in persuading those who already believe in the crisis but have not done anything to change their ways of living. Many of the believers of the climate crisis sadly despite knowing that the crisis is detrimental do nothing to prevent the crisis. I believe this article brings to light the lack of knowledge that the general population has on the climate crisis and brings to life one of the only surface level issues of this ongoing crisis.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, David Wallace did a great job informing us of the seriousness of global climate change. No wonder he is called an alarmist. The subtitles "Heat Death" caught my most attention partially because it sounds horrible. David points out that "At 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half the world’s population, as distributed today, would die of direct heat." which is enough to convince me to believe what he says. Nobody wants that to happen in the future. So please consider the climate change seriously for the future of humankind.

<p>
After watching David Wallace Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth”,  I was overwhelmed. The article did a great job of showing different aspects of the climate crisis, and linked each factor, such as heat, drought, food, air, ocean, and more, to a situation or disaster that will occur if we don’t respond. I also liked that the author not only scorching the surface but rather showed us much more deep consequences behind it all. I agree with the author that the reason why people all know that we are in a bad situation but they don’t make changes, it is because that “aversion arising from fear is a form of denial.” Many might think that their individual power is too invisible, there are more powerful, uncontrollable factors out there continue to do what they have been doing and our little steps can’t make any difference, our uncertainty about uncertainty stops us from preparing to the worst situation that might happen.

After reading David Wallace wells' article "the Unihabitable earth’’, I find the environment problem is more serious and critical than my thought. Before reading it, I used to think that whatever people do, the environment contamination is unavoidable. So I think the environment will not be damaged dramatically. But after reading, it really changes recognition. People’s activities have caused really huge problems to the earth which is the only place we can live. Bad air pollution, white contamination, and extinction of different creatures are caused by the human activities. Highly developed technology does make people live in a better life, but in some degree, it changed people’s life in an irreversible way. So what way should do is to develop our technology while prevent worse environment problems at the same time.

When reading this article, I felt very pessimistic about the future of our Earth and how we are taking care of it. I do believe in an almost boomerang effect Wallace-Wells certainly scares some people in a negative way that could deter them to not care, feeling Earth is just doomed for. I personally don't hold that attitude even after being startled by the information in the reading because I understand there are still ways humans can change and give a positive thumbprint on planet Earth.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” written by David Wallace-Well, he describes a sequence of specific climate change influence and thoughtful personal views about it. Although I know the climate crisis is a serious issue from the English 22 I took last quarter, I am still shocked when I read this article. At the beginning, he depicts the bad ending of “doomsday” if people do nothing with the contemporary environmental problems. Such climate change will bring sixth mass extinction along with human history. He states global warming will release diseases and melt ice and then massive disasters in the coming years. Finally, our earth will be “uninhabitable” and air will be “unbreathable.” While he posts a lot of facts and data to stress the consequence, his statements are impressive and convincing. He regarded himself as “alarmist” so that he indicates the worst ending of our human and earth. But he doesn’t exaggerate the current situation of environmental problems. From my perspective, even though the situation is severe, I am feeling optimistic about our future. Since our technology is still developing rapidly and human awareness of protecting the environment is increasing, I believe that more and more ways and people will take actions to minimize this disaster and even deal with global warming.

After reading the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I was shocked and concerned as to what climate change truly entails. I do believe in climate change, but honestly I will admit I have never been one to research these consequences myself. That being said, this is one of the first articles I have read about climate change, and I am sort of terrified with what is to come. I think the article was very informing, and I liked how he highlighted the urgency of this issue. I do think our world is turning its head and kind of ignoring what is actually going on. I feel like the general population is unaware of the hardships we will have to face. Like mentioned in the video, I think the author is scaring us into action, which in my opinion isn’t a bad way to raise awareness. I found it interesting how he says that when people hear climate change they really only think of sea level rising, which is an issue but when in reality it isn't the most prominent threat. I also like how he included information about the world’s mass extinctions, and how many people (especially the older generation) learned that they were all caused by asteroids, when in actuality they were caused by greenhouse gases. Something else I found particualry fascinating was the plague section of the article because that is something I wouldn't have thought of on my own. Diseases and bugs that are trapped in Arctic ice and can resurfaces and cause deaths. I believe this article contains a lot of great information and even if it's purpose is to "scare" people into action, I think a lot of people would benefit from reading it.

<p>
The “ Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells presents readers with new and shocking information regarding climate change, as well as the alarming consequences that are to come if we do not act quickly and spread the message. Before reading the article, I thought this would just present me with basic information that I had already heard. While the article presented me with that information, it also presented lots of alarming new information. David Wallace-Wells tackles what as humans we are doing wrong, the predictions of what is to come and what is happening and what has already happened because of our careless, ignorant actions. It also presents readers with possible information they had learned differently.
          <br><br>

One of the most alarming consequences of climate change that stood out to me the most was the section regarding climate pagues. This was a topic that I had never heard of when addressing climate change. I did not know that there were diseases trapped in the Arctic ice and could be “reanimated when unfrozen”. Although I was unaware of this information, it wasn’t shocking to learn that these prehistoric diseases could affect millions of people. Additionally, the ‘Doomsday’ section in the article also stood out to me. Throughout my life, I have always been told and taught that Earth has had five major extinctions due to asteroids. I was unaware that these extinctions had been a result of climate change through the production of greenhouse gases. It is alarming to know how there are most likely millions of individuals who are unaware of these basic facts. It helps us see how little knowledge on such important issues and how we need to educate ourselves and inform others of what is happening and how we can help.
          <br><br>

I do not believe Wallace-Wells should be categorized as an alarmist. While he does startle us with alarming information of what the future can hold, he isn’t exaggerating the consequences to force us to worry, he is simply presenting readers with real data that causes readers to question what they are doing to help this issue now and what they can be doing. He isn’t incapacitating us with fear, he is encouraging change to occur and holding ourselves accountable. Reading this caused me to feel as if I am doing little to nothing about climate change. It frightened me learning about adding carbon at much faster rates, and how we are harming not just ourselves, but everything around us. After reading this article, I felt the need to try to do better and take action. I believe I can make changes to my lifestyle to help reduce my overall carbon footprint and try to inform those around me of the dangers of climate change who don’t think it is important or do not know enough about it to understand it.

While reading the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" written by David Wallace-Wells, all I could feel was this sense of urgency, and the bluntness present in the article further empowered me to want to go out and do something about this. I definitely believe in climate change and the fact that we are on the road to essentially extinction, but I didn't know how bad it has gotten. For example, in the article Wallace-Wells states that the ice glaciers that have been melting for years hold over twice as much carbon as what's already in the atmosphere. That fact alone is frightening and I think he does a good job at stating the facts in an intimidating way that, at least for me, has the reader wanting to get up and start doing something about it. As I continued to read, one thing I thought about was how we have let this issue slide for so long. Climate change isn't a new idea that was conjured up in the 2000s. Rather it's been around so long that in 1998 "... satellite data showed the global warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought." If there was even the thought that this may continue to get worse over decades, why hadn't we done something earlier to combat this. Furthermore, with all of this irrefutable evidence, why are there still people out there that believe climate change is a hoax? 
          <br><br>
The article itself does a good job at really painting a picture of what our future is looking like. At the rate we're going at there really won't be much of the earth left, and it's concerning that it's already begun and people still choose to believe that it's something conjured up to scare us.

In the article “the uninhabitable earth, the author, David Wallace wells, outlines a grim future for mankind by going over many of the possible detrimental societal impacts the climate crisis could have. In addition to explaining well known problems such as rising sea levels, ocean acidification, greenhouse gas emissions, etc. Wells also goes over some important and less known facts of the climate crisis. For example, the fact that rising global temperatures might unleash century old diseases that current humans have no immunity is bewildering in and of itself and should be household knowledge when it becomes time for voters to hit the polls. 
          <br><br>


Although Wells effectively communicated the urgency of many climate crisis issues, I believe he undermined his argument with some arguments that seemed to be a bit excessive. I am no expert but the idea that rising temperatures align with more crime and war seems a lot like correlation and not causation. Moreover, when wells talked about the potential “permanent economic collapse”, I believe his ideas came off a bit hyperbolic as well. Again, I am no expert but it seemed to me that Wells was using capitalism as a scapegoat for the issue of fossil fuels when It could just be human nature. 
          <br><br>


All in all, I thought the article was a good read that was a bit too pessimistic. Optimism is what we need to solve this problem.

<p>
I entered David Wallace-Wells article "The Uninhabitable Earth" unaware and fairly uneducated on the topic of Climate Change. I underestimated the reality of which our home is going through and will continue to go through as our everyday habits are unbothered. The article surely used tactics which relentlessly scared me and made me realize I have been contributing to the destruction of our home because I was unaware of what was happening. The article mentioned that everyone has been turning a blind eye to this disaster but how long can that possibly continue on for? Our earth evidently will soon make adjustments that can no longer be ignored by us. It will eventually affect our every day lives. As I continued reading, I was feeling motivated to do everything I can in my personal life to help prevent continuous damage, but he failed to add realistic changes that anyone can make in their day to day lives. This gave me an uneasy feeling considering I was leaving the article with all this new information but no tips or changes that I can make in my own life.



</p><hr>


<p>
I felt extremely disturbed by the information I read in the article. I already had a general idea about how climate change would cause rising temperatures and sea levels, but I was not aware of just how drastic the situation was. I learned that there are multitudes of ways in which climate change will harm our planet, and as I read each new, horrible consequence I began to feel more despair. I understand that this article assumes that humans change nothing about their actions, yet learning about how people could die from walking outside, how farmland will be seriously diminished, and how centuries-old diseases could reemerge underscored just how dire the climate crisis is.
          <br><br>


I do think the article is alarmist, yet I also believe it is justified. The article clearly states that these consequences will only occur in the absence of human action, which highlights the fact that human action must be taken. We must be aware of the worst-case scenario if we wish to stop it from happening.

After reading the article, "The Uninhabited Earth", which was written and published by David Wallace-Wells, and also after taking few comments down below into my personal concerns, I have to say that i trully appreciate how Mr. Wallace-Wells has done so much hard work on reinforcing and raising people's awareness of our current environment situation. He's been alarming us all through this article. Yes i do agree with some of my classmates say he's an alarmist. People always think these researchers or scientists are greatly exaggerating the truth. But do you guys ever think about the truth which was hidden behind those sugarcoated news or some people just want to hide these truth for getting benefits for themselves. Maybe David is an "alarmist", and he might be exaggerating the real situation.
           <br><br>
However what about the global warming crisis? what about the disappearing situations of animal species? How about those "natural disasters"?? People will be punished by the nature one day if they keep destroying our living place for self benefits, if the industries keep exploiting all the nature resources and producing uncountable trash which damage the living system and environmental situations for the rest of living species left on the Earth. But i do trust we will come together to save our planet. That's why Ken is here and that's why we are here. We are supposed to and we must be able to put it in action. The future is now

Prior to reading David Wallace-Wells’ article, “An Uninhabitable Earth”, I watched this video that details some of the very real consequences that have risen from anthropogenic climate change—including the lack of action taken by many humans. In response to some of the questions posed within this video in regular to Wallace-Wells’ article, I do not think that the tone of his piece is too alarmist. There was a strong reaction in opposition to the article, but I believe that this kind of a reaction is necessary to some extent for proponents of climate change when publishing their work—hopefully reaching the right group of people and driving them to act. Wallace-Wells did present quite a terrifying future which may turn away certain readers, but hopefully the majority of readers are able to extract the importance of this piece and are driven to action.



</p><hr>


<p>
David Wallace-Wells’ article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” is absolutely remarkable for the amount of statistical data it gathers and explains, but unfortunately, each and every number he put out to explain the crisis only served to further paralyze me. However, I think that is because I am not his intended audience. As someone who is already terrifyingly convinced of climate change’s reality and inevitability, this article made me want to curl up into a ball and cry. (To be fair though, it doesn’t take much to reduce me to tears.) I may have been pretty ignorant to much of the statistical knowledge I just learned, but it doesn’t take all this information to understand that climate change will be devastating. Learning about the death of the Great Barrier Reef last quarter was enough to make me attempt to consume less and be more conscientious of my environmental footprint. 
           <br><br>

The real audience of Wallace-Wells’ piece is for those who are not yet convinced, and I think it probably does wonders in that regard. I want to say that this piece is not alarmist because it tries its best to convey a scientific truth. The author is not simply making abstract claims out of some desire for personal gain, which I feel is what alarmists would do. It just happens that the simple reality of the situation is immensely alarming. 20% of the population in the sugarcane region of El Salvador has chronic kidney disease and that is a fact. Melting permafrost has the potential to release deadly diseases we haven’t seen in years and that is also just a fact. Wars deeply connected to climate change and other issues that result from it, like water scarcity and environmental instability, are occuring as we speak. And even if this piece were alarmist, what is the downside of acting to improve our lives? That is an argument I simply do not understand.   
           <br><br>

The part of the article that stuck with me the most and was most compelling would have to be VIII. Poisoned Oceans. We are attending an oceanside school, right up next to the coastline. We are in the right spot to be in huge danger in the event of sea level rise, and that isn’t even all it can do. Ocean acidification is so overwhelming because of how little we know about its depths. If even the ocean, a wide, unknowable mass, is starting to develop dead zones, then I really fear for the future.



</p><hr>


<p>
"The Uninhabitable Earth" was one of the most illuminating articles I have read about the consequences of climate change. I particularly appreciated Wallace-Wells comment that a majority of people simplify the consequences of climate change to marginally rising sea levels, maybe they consider slowly rising temperatures, without really considering the full implications of these effects. Economies will crumble as a high population of people live near the coast, rising temperatures lead to increased violence and more extreme weather, and little by little, year by year we may very well reduce to anarchy or other great climate calamity and watch society and humanity fall. Wallace-Wells goes further into detail then I have ever read before about the true potential repercussions of climate change, looking far into the future with a butterfly effect perspective of how our gross consumption will be our great demise.

           <br><br>

After finishing reading the article, I feel a great call to action to change our grim destiny of becoming a society gone and forgotten. I reject a reality where we are doomed for failure. I would not say that I am a 'technocrat' as Wallace-Wells puts it who believes that all our problems now can be solved by future technology so why even bother worrying about all this climate stuff now when the future can solve it all, but I believe we need to put a great deal more effort and energy towards solving the global climate crisis now before it is irreversible. I think an alarmist attitude is more progressive than any other kind of attitude, as other mindsets might not urge the same call to action and issue complacency more than the full effort we need to be giving this crisis so our generation may actually live to see the next one.

<p>
What I appreciate about the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells is the fact that he takes a very extreme approach to the effects of climate change and does not shy away from the scary realities that climate change is predicted to bring about, the softening of the effects often  make it easier to put off the changes that need to be made immediately and that is not what we need right now, and let's be honest fear motivates people. I find the point of climate plagues to be extremely interesting and not often talked about in regards to the effects of climate change so it was really interesting that it was included. I also appreciate the point on how war is one of the effects of climate change because even if we look at now, a lot of the US's conflicts currently have to do with fighting over resources and that will only get worse in the face of scarcity all over the planet. I hope that this article opens a lot of peoples eyes to the very real effects of climate change and what will happen if we don't start implementing immediate change.

Wallace-Wells and Hiltner both do an effective job at presenting the potential ‘uninhabitable Earth’ in a frightening yet serious manner filled with facts. As a reader and listener, being presented with hard evidence is hard to turn down, and my attitude is more likely swayed. Hiltner’s addition of the article “Seven Numbers that Show How Dire Climate Change Got Over the Last Decade” is effective in listing the facts of our contributions to the crisis as well as the past consequences that have occured in the last ten years that are categorized as extreme when compared to those of previous decades. Hiltner’s use of adding this evidence to the end of his video is similar to Wallace-Wells’ style of writing in his article “The Uninhabitable Earth” when he states how much has changed in a single generation, and how much is going to continue to change if we don’t take proactive measures. I find it very interesting the way Wallace-Wells writes. He blatantly states facts without exaggerating because there is simply no need to exaggerate. The honest proof is scary enough.

<p>
This article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells is an alarming article for us because it shows us many probabilities of disastrous climate change that we may have never imagined. For example, he mentioned that we might have noticed the existence of too much greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, the process of global warming isn’t as “not so obvious” as the temperature rising for a few decimals of degrees. It is indeed, an uninvertible process after such a tipping point. He mentioned that there is a huge amount of methane trapped under the ice caps of the Antarctica area. If current global warming continues to melt the ice caps and release methane, a kind of greenhouse gas that is over 30 times stronger than Carbon Dioxide, into our atmosphere. Then the global temperature will keep rising is we won’t have any ways to stop that. Wells highlighted the problem with the more-important underlying fact behind global warming.
           <br><br>
 Wells is definitely trying to tell the readers one thing that they are maybe not completely aware of what the situation is like nowadays. He gave examples of probable extreme endings of some climate crisis such as dying from heat, end of food or climate plague. What’s special about this article I think is that it’s not just about extinction of some other species like articles somewhere else. This one is seriously talking about the probable extinction of human race, which is a topic that is barely mentioned by most of scientists. It’s true that all the hypothesis are based on extreme guesses, we still can’t ignore the serious harm behind climate change. It’s just like the wild fire going on right now in Australia. Maybe no one thought it could span to such a huge coverage at the beginning, but if the problem is there, we still should try to solve it.

The article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells demonstrates the severity of our world, which will get us closer to Doomsday. It's also alarming how emergency we, as human being, should really take action to protect our environment and resources. Environmentalists and leaders must be responsible for carrying out plausible ways for people to actually reduce the emission of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere. On the other side, I was shocked by the fast pace of the mass extinction of the species that Wells mentioned in the article. Although the author states that the mass extinctions were caused by the Greenhouse effect, I don’t really believe in this saying. Mass extinctions are, in fact, mostly caused by human actions that human beings are not really aware of. However, the author presents a pretty good amount of evidence and trustworthy examples to make the public aware that we should truly put efforts in the unwanting and unwelcoming environment that we are living around.

<p>
In Wells' article, he takes a different approach in conveying his message about the impacts of climate change in a different manner. I have read numerous articles that merely summarize the problems that we are facing globally and lightly touch on potential solutions that only provide some sort of buffer for climate change. Wells does a well job on going more in depth with issues and impacts. Just by even reading the first couple of paragraphs, he talks about things that I didn't even know that climate change had to even do with that and I was definitely surprised and interested with what he had to say. The way in which he approached the topic was alarming but to a certain extent and definitely gave me something to ponder about. I like that he divided his points into categories by pulling in from the economics side, the global health side, the agricultural side, etc to give a well rounded statement. Topics such as the Doomsday global food bank and Climate Plagues were new concepts that I didn't even think about at first. It's unfortunate that there are still some individuals who are in denial about what's going on around them and so I hope Wells was able to convey an important message and leave some sort of impact. Towards the end of the article he asked why we, as humans, don't treat climate change as an immediate disaster that takes priority over other things. His overall message is very important and I hope others can learn something from it.

While reading the article "The Uninhabitable Earth", a constant thought I had was "how have we let things become so bad?" If a rise in temperature is inevitable, why have we not acted sooner to lessen the increase to a less severe degree? Author David Wallace is strategic when using intense descriptions to evoke a reaction out of the reader. He is blunt in his explanations of the expectations of the grim future; this is to expose the reader, and the population, to the consequences of climate change. The separations of each topic within the article makes me understand  the enormity of the situation more because the distinction is more matter-of-fact than one stream of consciousness.

I wish there  had been descriptions of actions that could have been taken in the past and what could be done now to remedy in the severity of climate change. I feel like there should be more of a balance of the morbidity of the tone and an optimistic outlook, however, this did show that this is an inevitable reality. I was oblivious to most of the actual consequences of climate change. I am terrified and saddened because this could have been improved or avoided.

I think that David Wallace provides a necessarily pessimistic view on the issue of climate change. Although people can be quick to dismiss this perspective as overly alarmist, he is entirely right in saying that we must take aggressive action now if we are to avoid devastating consequences. Wallace displays the implications of climate change that most people have never even considered. One of the consequences that stood out to me was the connection between global increase in temperature and rate of conflict. It was surprising to me that climate change could lead to war but it makes sense now that I think about it. Another statistic that shocked me deeply was that CO2 rates are projected to possibly hit 1000ppm by 2100. This would cause less brain functionality and shorter life spans. It blew me away when I read that there are immensely harmful diseases waiting to be released by melting permafrost; it is as if it is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. These effects are so real and so terrifying that it is a mystery to me that people are still reticent to take personal action regarding the climate crisis. Overall, this article saddened me because it made me doubt the possibility of mitigating environmental damage. I think that our current world is too focused on the profit and that large companies will not change their practices until it is too late. This article evoked a visceral reaction within me because I had nearly forgotten how large of a crisis humankind is in until this article reminded me. This problem should be at the fore of every human's consciousness yet most people do not even know the slightest bit about it. I also fear that even if people do finally become informed on the subject they will still not take action because of their tragedy of the commons mentality.

David Wallace-Wells instills fear in the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth.” Fear as a force is utilized in order to promote a more conscious collective of people on earth, instead of confused crowds. Alienating people as a means of creating togetherness is clever because it isn’t like it’s solely one person’s obligation to end climate change, instead masses of informed people can choose how/where to put their effort in making the world cleaner.
           <br><br>
In describing the inevitable climate plagues, I’d never lost hope so quickly in my life. The climate plagues described reached into my childhood fears of contracting a life-threatening disease. Because permafrost captured old diseases, and will melt down at some point, prehistoric plagues will surface. While not all of them may survive, there is a lot that isn’t known about how these diseases will function upon surfacing. Yet, thinking about the potential for impending doom should generally send people, like myself, into a frenzy. However, beginning to understand climate change as a crisis allows me to feel better informed considering I sort of know what to anticipate. Even if the crisis affects me in uncalled for ways, being educated on the subject allows for me to lead a life that’s healthier for the planet because I’m further knowledgeable in ways I wasn’t previous to reading this article.

After reading a good amount of articles revolving around the issues arising from climate change, I believe David Wallace’s article has been one of the one’s that has stood out to me the most. Although he took an alarmist approach, he presented the reader with an image of how the world would be affected through the lense of different topics- ocean acidification, food production and agriculture, heat death, and more. I find it interesting how if the ice on our planet continues to melt, diseases that our bodies aren’t prepared to fight off will be brought to the surface. I can only assume that these diseases will result in the unfortunate deaths of thousands, maybe even millions, of people.
           <br><br>
The alarmingly increasing rate of ocean acidification won’t only affect the coral reefs in our oceans, but all of marine life as well. Not only will it be harder to hunt fish for our consumption, but these fish populations will literally die from how hot the water will become. It makes me sad because the animals found on this planet are dying off due to our actions. Because of our selfish ways, these beautiful, precious animals are slowly becoming extinct as time passes.

In “The Uninhabitable Earth,” David Wallace explains the consequences that climate change can bring whether humanity changes their actions or not. Before reading this article, I understood that climate change was a serious issue, but now I have an understanding of why our response to fixing it needs to be a group effort. Despite the approach that Wallace takes in his article, I think he should not be considered an “alarmist.” While I can see why readers may depict him as so, I think Wallace’s intentions were not to scare his audience into taking action but to simply inform them of things they should be aware of. Not to say that after reading it, I did not feel alarmed or that any move I made felt pointless because Earth is dying, but I think those emotions were due to my lack of knowledge before reading this article. It was interesting to see how David Wallace elaborated on the specific reactions that our earth would have on climate change and its effect on all life. He focuses on climate change’s effect on heat death, the end of food, climate plagues, war, economic collapse, and the great filter. While each analysis was equally frightening, the most that caught me off guard was permanent economic collapse. Thinking about climate change, it is obvious that life on earth would be thrown out of balance, especially because everything is interconnected: the oceans, the plants, the animals, humans, but I did not realize how seriously it would affect our economy as well. Each point made by Wallace honestly made me disappointed in myself. Being in college, and barely having a surface-level understanding of climate change’s consequences until now and because of this article makes me wonder why more people do not know this, and why I was not taught about it sooner. 
           <br><br>

David Wallace understands the seriousness of climate change and depicts an intense frustration with humanity’s lack of understanding throughout “The Uninhabitable Earth”. It is clear to see why Wallace lists out the consequences in detail and with no repercussions, because once everything is set to place, these consequences will not hold back. There is no way to reverse the damage already caused, what’s left is creating ways to delay the expected.

What I loved most about David Wallace-Wells article “The Uninhabitable Earth” was how blunt he was with all the different death scenarios the world could unleash on us if no action is taken. This really made me realize that rising sea levels are the least of our problems. I am the most concerned with the rising temperature of already historically warm areas. Coming from the Central Valley of California I am familiar with people dying every summer from extreme heat. The sad reality is that many of these deaths are usually lower class senior citizens who can not afford to run their AC units at all times throughout the summer months. This scenario is the one I personally can visualize the best as I know with rising temperatures the lower class and elderly will be the ones most affected. Wallace does a very good job explaining that all these scenarios are not necessarily going to happen but that with no action taken any one of them could lead to the end of life as we know it. I think it important to explain all the ways the earth will change instead of just focusing on rising sea levels because this will prepare us for what to expect.

This article by David Wallace-Wells was a huge reality check on the state of our Earth. Before this article and before I enrolled in English 23, I knew that the climate crisis was one of the biggest (if not the biggest) issue my generation faces today. While I knew about many consequences could potentially occur within the next decade, this article gave true timeline of the future of Earth as the temperature increases. To be honest, I was not that fearful of the climate crisis. However, after reading this article, global warming has now been added to things to worry about on top of upcoming due dates, midterms, and homework.
           <br><br>

Wallace-Wells speaks with urgency and I think he has good reason to be. He understands that Earth simply does not enough time. He speaks honestly and does not sugar coat anything. Instead of talking about the effects of the Earth after 2 degree increase, Wallace-Wells is more concerned about the effects after 3+ degree increase. According to Wallace-Wells, we are currently in the midst of the sixth mass extinction and Miami and Bangladesh will cease to exist within the next century. Although this may seem extreme, he is starting the right conversation.
           <br><br>

I liked the points Wallace-Wells made about things that could be triggered by global warming.  
           <br><br>
I had no idea that Arctic permafrost holds 1.8 trillion tons of carbon that could be released into the atmosphere when it melts. I also did not know that there are diseases that are inside the Arctic ice that have not been released for millions of years. It seems that the human race is on its way to extinction. These shocking facts made me realize how uncertain the future is as temperature increases. This article’s pressing tone effectively makes readers fearful of climate change in hopes of sparking change. I feel that I have a responsibility to do my part in this fight before it is too late.



</p><hr>


<p>
I went into the weekly reading thinking that it would just be another scientist spewing facts and statistics. Instead, Wallace-Wells shows us, in detail, each possible way Earth is vulnerable to climate change. He also states multiple times throughout the article the gravity of our current situation and how we have basically already caused irreversible damage. He makes it known that it's a lot more serious than we think, which, in all honesty, is terrifying. 
           <br><br>


Like Professor Hiltner states in the above video, David Wallace-Wells is trying to scare us into taking action by listing the past five mass extinctions and telling us how similar the circumstances surrounding those were to our present situation. The ones that scared me the most were "the end of food" and "climate plagues" but the one that really hit home was "Heat death". This can be attributed to the Australian wildfires. Not only have dozens of people died, one BILLION animals have died, meaning that the scenario that Wallace Wells talks about in his article is already a reality. This, alone, is absolutely gut-wrenching and horrifying. 
           <br><br>


Going back to the whole "alarmist" approach taken by Wallace Wells, I completely agree and support it. Although climate change deniers might think he is lying and trying to create conflict, most of the population will take it seriously and use it as nothing short of a wake up call. Overall, I believe that this article is very effective in promoting awareness of climate change and the horrors that come alone with it.

<p>
David Wallace-Well’s “The Uninhabitable Earth" undoubtedly emphasized an already existing concern of mine. However, what I felt after reading his article in comparison to taking an environmental science class had a notable distinction. Many of us are already aware that without immediate action, we are bound to face damaging consequences. It is not difficult to make this connection on your own. However, it was the way Wallace-Well alarms the reader into foreseeing this destruction of our future reality. Even by the way he starts the article, “It is, I promise, worse than you think,” and continues to underscore this sort of attitude of eventual doom makes the idea extremely hard to ignore.
           <br><br>


Although this is one future he builds upon, I thought that the way he constantly assured the reader that they were not truly as aware as they thought they were about the reality of our planet was effective in evoking an emotional response. Perhaps I felt this way because I resonated with what he was saying on an even more personal level, “even within the lifetime of a teenager today,” and truthfully, I don’t doubt that my idea of things is a far underestimate of the reality of it. The fear created after reading this had a much more lasting effect than my enviro-sci class, one that makes me want to contribute--even if it is just a little. I may not be taking as much action after reading this as I should, but I cannot deny that immersing myself into Wallace-Well’s description of our potential reality has made me much more considerate than before, specifically considerate of my very own lifestyle choices.

<p>
It is astonishing to me how the issues behind the climate crisis haven't been in mainstream media until a few years ago. It seems to me that the elevating response to the climate crisis follows any other world event, where people act as out of response rather than preemptively trying to solve issues that will arise in the future. I believe that this is based on the vast public being ignorant and unaware of the totality that the climate crisis will have on the future. It is difficult to get people to care about an issue without some sort of incentive to spur change, and in Well's article, he present some very scary talking points that paint a future reality of irreversible climate change.
           <br><br>

In my opinion, it isn't enough to inform the public of issues that climate change causes; as people learn from history. Just look at the wild fires going on the Australia, this event has resulted in debate over saving the animals but I haven't seen a large response acquitting this the climate change. People realize that there is some forms of climate change happening in the world but have no idea about the true extent that it reaches and I would have put myself into this group before taking this class.
           <br><br>

I have a question that is summarized from the reading:
           <br><br>
How can I get others to not just to be informed about the climate crisis, but create positive change in their ecological habits?




</p><hr>


<p>
"The Uninhabitable Earth" should not be seen as alarmist and fear mongering, but should instead be accepted as the fate of the planet if climate change is not curbed. Wallace Well's pointing out how our carbon emission rates are 10 times that of an extinction that led of the death of 97% of life on Earth really puts into perspective how large of a problem this is. The scenarios stated should not dishearten people, but rather serve as a warning against those educated on the topic. The article is sure to motivate those who are aware of climate change, but have yet to take on an incentive to combat the problem change their habits for the better.
           <br><br>


The approach that Wallace Wells uses matches the severity of the issue being addressed. Just because the state of the future is shocking does not make it an alarmist piece. At the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions, the article becomes more of a sentence than a prediction for human life on Earth. This is highlighted by how today's generation have already started to experience the devastating effects of climate change. This shows that it is no longer a problem for future generations, but rather one that is threatening the lives of people in the present.

<p>
David Wallace-Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth," addresses both the larger impacts of climate change and the smaller implications to our daily lives and abilities to survive. By delineating the specific processes by which climate change occurs and the subsequent impacts (ex. the melting of permafrost leading to rising sea temperatures and sea levels, thus causing land masses with large populations to disappear under the water) and emphasizing the impact environmental degradation has on humans, he creates a sense of urgency in the most effective way: by appealing to human selfishness. 
           <br><br>

I believe "The Uninhabitable Earth" is a much more terrifying and effective article primarily because it focuses on how environmental changes will be harmful towards humans, specifically. By discussing how many people suffer due to issues such as poor air quality and how many populations will be displaced by climate change, he creates a sense of fear in the reader. While many pieces about climate change focus on habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity (which he does address, and both of which are incredibly important issues), Wallace-Wells targets his readers most effectively by making the issue directly personal for them and showing them the direct effects of climate change on human life and activity, as opposed to relying on people believing in the inherent value of nature and wildlife as many other climate activists do. I found this an interesting and convincing approach to sway his readers, but also felt disappointed that people (and corporations) as a whole value wildlife and nature so little that Wallace-Wells felt urged to pose the issue by heavily discussing impacts on humans.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, he gives great information addressing the problem of climate change. He not only dives into defining climate change but he gives information about the effects that it has on the entire earth. He brings up about how without change in human actions then it will influence our life now and for the generation to come. I could not believe the consequences of our actions. I kept asking myself "is it even possible to change our lifestyle" or "is it too late to even do anything" and more importantly "how much more time do we have left." I always knew that climate change was a major problem but I did not know it was THE problem. I knew what climate change was but I never really knew the reasons or the actual effects that it will cause. This article made me change how I felt about climate change because I will be alive when the problem finally comes upon us. And being able to prevent that will be difficult especially for the earth as a whole. I believe if everyone read this article or was informed with this type of information then people would feel different about it. This article perfectly explains the problem, give information about the causes and effects, possible solutions, and impossible habits we can not resolve.

<p>
I did not think that “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallice-Wells was too “alarmist” as an article, but rather I found it to be compelling and inarguable. I like to think of myself as knowledgeable about the climate crisis, but the truth of the matter, as pointed out by Wallace-Wells, is that so much relevant information is widely unknown by the public. Because I believe in climate change, I was quick to accept Wallace-Wells pictures of the multiple types of widespread destruction described in the article that may be our future. I do think, however, that someone who may be skeptical of climate change is forced to at least take the matter seriously when presented with these possible disasters. The most compelling part of the article, to me, was the section about economic collapse. I think that in today's political climate, especially in the United States, this is something that is important to the very people who are against climate change prevention, and hopefully this can help to sway them. While reading the article, I found myself feeling worried and anxious, prompted to sit down and cry, but as I read the last paragraph I did feel slightly reassured. The ending of the article discusses scientist’s “confidence in the ingenuity of humans,” and shifted the attention of the reader from the nightmarish images of doomsday, to the heroic and awesome powers and actions of people. I was left feeling grateful for the knowledge that I gained, and with energy, optimism, and curiosity as to what we as humans do next to fight this global catastrophe.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells a very thought provoking article that provided many different examples of how our actions today are predicted to affect the world in the near future. In grade school we learned about climate change and how it would affect the world one day, however, I did not believe I would experience seeing the consequences so soon. This article goes in depth about the different ways our planet will be affected if the climate crisis continues to worsen, which is predicted to do so if we don’t take action soon. It is predicted that many parts of undeveloped countries will become uninhabitable. Many crops will not be able to grow due to the increase in temperature that is predicted to occur. Permafrost is predicted to melt and release up to 1.8 trillion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Although many people are in denial about these things happening, they are already occurring at a slow rate and it is worrisome.
           <br><br>

After reading the article I was both saddened and inspired to take action. Although David Wallace’s alarmist tactic of bringing fear about the future into our lives inspired me to take action it might have scared/alienated certain readers, like Ken mentioned in his lecture video. However, if that were to be the case I do believe that those who were not prompted to take action are now more educated about the climate crisis which can lead to conversation and possible action in the future.

<p>
This article is very similar to many other article readings based on climate change and our planet. Within these types of articles, it is a constant reminder that action must be made to help save our planet. David Wallace-Wells expresses in The Uninhabitable Earth that thinking about the future of our planet is extremely important. With Wallace-Wells' alarmist attitude, it is justifiable to have this type of tone simply due to the fact that others do not take this subject matter as serious as it is. I thought it was very informative for Wallace-Wells to include the subdivisions on certain factors that will occur to our planet as Earth continues to warm up. With including these, it is evident that many countries around the world actual face the struggles of Global Warming more than we do, which is a justifiable reason for Wallace-Wells' tone in this article being intimidating and alarming. This alarming attitude really showcases the importance and truth about what is going on around the world. I believe many do not take this subject as serious as Wallace-Wells simply due to the fact that they are not as educated as others on the factors that will occur as well as continue to occur in the world. Many individuals are ignorant about the topic of Global Warming and climate change because they think they cannot do anything about it; which is why it is important to share this articles- or even any other article related to this topic- to others to allow them to understand that our future and our planet's future really is at risk. With the help of the population, a little can go a long way in helping not only ours but also our planet's future.

<p>
The article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells brought to light multiple harmful effects of global warming that I was completely unaware of. Effects such as war and economic collapse are hazards that I have never considered to be related to climate change, yet they now seem to be extremely relevant to our planet's future as it deals not with the environmental consequences, but with potential social-economic hazards. 
           <br><br>


While the article explicitly warns us of our impending doom,  I can see why there are many skeptics and climate-change deniers. Wallace-Wells clearly does well in articulating a dire warning to convince climate-change activists and believers the detrimental effects of global warming, but the article doesn't do enough to convince skeptics that this issue is real, as opposed to dire. Wallace-Wells spends too much of the article - 8 sections - repeating the fact that our planet is dying, while spending too few words on why climate change is real. The last section succeeds in this effort, but it's highly unlikely that a climate-change denier would read the article in its entirety, as they would have no reason to. 

           <br><br>

That being said, I am hopeful that those who do take Wallace-Well's warnings to heart will be spurred to action, whether it be protesting or taking actions of their own. environmental policies. Perhaps with prioritizing our planet over money, especially for those in positions of power to influence environmental and business policy, we can avoid the future with an uninhabitable earth.

<p>
The dictionary definition of an  alarmist is “someone who is considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic”. By categorizing Wells as alarmist, we are implying that the impacts of climate change that Wells references are inherently exaggerated. However, this is clearly not the case. Each claim that Wells makes is backed up well by facts and concrete statistics about how our currently way of life would eventually lead to the mentioned outcomes. 
           <br><br>
The most compelling section from this article was the one about “Perpetual War”. In this section, Wells mentions that climate change may be directly related to the rise in conflict around the world. Wells mentions three significant reasons: 1) Forced migration (due to climate changes in certain geographic areas) 2) Agriculture and economics and 3) Individual irritability (hotter weather has been shown to lead to increased municipal crime rates. 
           <br><br>
Reading this article instilled a heightened sense of fear in my about the potential impacts of climate change. Before reading this article, I had a general idea of how climate change can lead to severely negative impacts but I realized that I could not identify any actual changes. Wells helps fill this gap by providing concrete examples and rationale predictions. By providing these concrete examples, and splitting up the article into nine major sections, people are able to see the actual potential impact of climate change. I believe that this in turn would lead to more actionable efforts rather than a hopeless mindset.

<p>
“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was the most detailed and eye opening articles that I have read on the impacts that climate change has had, and will continue to have, on our planet. Prior to reading the article, I thought I was, at least somewhat, familiar with the future of how climate change would alter and destroy the planet as we know it. In reality David Wallace-Wells introduces many realities of climate change that I was completely unaware of. Concepts like “climate plague” and “unbreathable air” serve as eye opening examples of how the consequences of climate change extend far beyond the consequences most often associated with the matter.

           <br><br>

While David Wallace-Wells does paint a picture of a terrifying, borderline unbearable world in an “alarmist”attitude that strikes fear in to the reader, this is a completely valid approach to take on the matter. In examining the data on how we have already affected the climate, it is clear that we need immediate changes in order to save our planet. When first exposed to the harsh reality it can be easier to freeze in fear and avoid taking any action than to actually make change. The article shows how immediate and serious consequences can be, and in turn gets the reader to think about their personal actions and effects on the climate, as well as larger social and governmental actions' effects on climate. in both cases this increased attention hopefully contributes to more conscientious action and legislation.

Having already gone through the first week of class, I’m even more alarmed than before, and the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells did not ease any optimism that I had for the future. When the article mentioned how an ice sheet has separated from Antarctica at the time of its writing, my mind immediately went to the Antarctica class that I’m taking this quarter, and how drastic changes can be to the continent’s maps. It then takes me to the realization that no class about Antarctica today, or geography in general, can be taught without any mention of the environment crisis. Even the Dinosaurs class I took last quarter mentioned greenhouse gases and its contribution to extinction.
           <br><br>
It’s almost as if we’re trapped. Solutions like Air Conditioners, as Wells mentions, only add to the carbon problem. Reading the article, I wasn’t necessarily panicked but more eager to find an optimistic way to look at the future. To think of a world where the ocean isn’t safe to swim in but just a toxic sea, a reminder of mankind’s treatment, is terrifying. It's great that this past year the issue of the climate crisis has become more prominent in places like the internet, and especially how younger people are playing a major role in taking care of a future that the past has nearly destroyed.



</p><hr>


<p>
The “Uninhabitable Earth” brought up many devastating possibilities that could result in the end of human life, along with other organisms. Before reading the article, I had not imagined some of these consequences, such as an unbearably hot planet and a sweeping climate plague. It seems as if the majority of climate change discourse neglects some of these possible realities as they are uncertain to occur and seem dramatic to many. However, the author makes it very clear through his scientific evidence that these potential realities are not so far fetched. There is a number of factors that make us doomed for the future of the planet, which are more likely to occur as humans’ ecological footprint worsens. Therefore, although the author uses an alarmist standpoint, we must consider these possibilities. For, in the past we have largely underestimated the downfall of the the Earth, just like how satellite data depicted that since 1998, the globe warmed more than twice as fast as scientists thought.



</p><hr>


<p>
I confess that if I didn’t take Ken’s class and had access to these articles that summarize tons of horrible scientific data and facts, I will never actively dig into this topic so deeply and will never go deeper in the future although I always know and had experienced the consequences of climate change. The most alarming part of “The Uninhabitable Earth” for me is the discussion around “Unbreathable Air.” In 2016, the heaviest breakout air pollution happened in my hometown, Beijing. The air in the city was for sure unbreathable and smell bad though PM2.5 was said flavorless. I, as a Grade 10 student, together with my classmates was forced to leave school and had online classes.  
           <br><br>

This is the first time that I was so close to the touchable danger, and we all know this would not be the last time if people globally don’t take action. As mentioned in David’s article, the whole globe will suffer because of all kinds of possible dangers. Though people’s awareness of this issue is arising, the power is not strong enough to cut the complicated interest-based relationship of all kinds. Nature outweighs the temporary benefits. Earth is not disposable.



</p><hr>


<p>
Out of all of the articles I have ever read relating to climate change, the article, The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells, might have been one of the more eye-opening ones. It is outlined as being broken up into nine parts, each one describing the most honest and chilling predictions of what the world will look like in the near future due to the effects of climate change. Wallace-Wells does a good job of being brutally honest with his readers, even with the very first sentence that states, “It is, I promise, worse than you think.” This makes for good shock value and makes them seem very genuine, getting straight to the point that everyone needs to be alarmed by climate change. 
           <br><br>


While the different sections talk about very interesting predictions having to do with sea-level rise, heat death, and air pollution, the sections having to do with the issues of food/water were particularly interesting to me. Growing up in California, I am very familiar with droughts and how they can affect your day to day life. The article describes that as soon as the year 2080, more than half of the world could be in a state of permanent extreme drought. And in terms of food, with each degree in warming, crop yield declines by 10%. These are extremely scary predictions,  especially with a steadily growing world population. The world will simply not be able to sustain everyone, which will most likely lead to increased social conflicts. That reminded me of a documentary that I had watched in an environmental science class that stated that most, if not all of the wars in the 21st century will revolve around water. 

           <br><br>

The end of the article explains what needs to be done in order to hopefully not permanently destroy the earth. Wallace outlines the solution as follows: cut carbon emission from industry and energy by half each decade, get emissions from land use to be zero, and there must be technology that can extract carbon from the atmosphere at rate two-times as fast as plants can. We need to take these extreme measures right away before it is too late.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” I was astounded by what I hadn’t previously known. As an environmental studies major, I had worried that many of my lectures and material would monotonously drone on about the same facts, but this article provided a plethora of information that I had no idea about. I found the most interesting and alarming section to be Heat Death. I think the fact that an 11 or 12 degree warming increase would be lethal to more than half the worlds population should be screamed across the nation. And at a 7 degree increase there would be death around the tropics. These are facts that everyone should know. This fear needs to be instilled in the human race, because when our lives are truly put at stake, there will be true effort put into saving the planet.

Once I came about completing David Wallace-Wells climate alarmist article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I was shocked upon understanding how people around the globe have managed to brush other, more threatening consequences of climate change under the rug and almost solely center the terror around sea level rise. I, personally, did not think Wallace Wells was being too alarmist at all. The globe is terrified of sea level rise (mostly on the coasts), but we won't be able to reach the point of that destruction if we don't comprehend the other mayhem that will unfold much quicker. His alarmist viewpoint does isolate his work from people who don't enjoy to hear about such terrors as death by heat and an unbreathable climate, but nonetheless, his alarmist standpoint is very much needed if people are going to join the fight for change. With this standpoint, also comes the risk of incapacitating some of his readers as well (to a point where readers will believe its far too late to change), but without having this knowledge to read in the first place, or by sugarcoating it, nothing will get done. After completing the read,  I initially felt hopeless (especially after understanding the idea that 1.8 trillion tons of C02 could very potentially be released into the atmosphere), almost as if there was nothing that could be done. But after taking time to myself to think, I came to feel empowered to share these facts with people I knew, as I believed and still do believe that the only way to save our planet and the human race is by sharing this climate change knowledge with anyone and everyone you know.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, it is evident what Wells is trying to accomplish with his article. He is trying to use fear and glimpses into a grim future caused by uncontrolled climate change with claims to back these futures up to spring his audience into action against climate change. I can not comment on the effectiveness of this strategy of banding people together against fighting climate change because when using fear as a motivation to act there are a certain number of people that will be immobilized by fear which would be counterproductive in achieving Wells's goal with the article. To the question of whether or not Wells is a climate alarmist, this is predicated on whether or not Wells is causing additional and unwarranted panic with his article. There is no doubt that climate change is a global issue that demands attention so bringing up grim possibilities of uncontrolled climate change wouldn’t grant Wells the label of an alarmist on its own but intentionally using misinformation to create additional panic would as it is unwarranted. Wells did this with his claim that "the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen" and cites the rainforest foundation. In his own source, nowhere does it state the Amazon alone provides 20% of the Earth oxygen but instead states that all rainforests combined produce about 20% of the world's oxygen. It is more accurate to claim that the Amazon produces 6-9% of total oxygen produced, but more importantly, the Amazon essentially produces net-zero oxygen. Wells's use of this claim is either disingenuous or as a product or poor journalistic research standards.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I think Wallace-Wells does come off too alarmist to an average reader. While his article is very in depth and considers nearly all factors when it comes to climate change, I believe that he does come off a little too strong and an average reader who is not already familiar with the disastrous nature of climate change would be filled with what they would feel as unnecessary fear. The effects of climate change that he explains are if earth’s average temperature rises more than the predicted 2 degrees Celsius, and if no changes are taken by us humans. Instead of envisioning a more reasonable future, he assumes the worst-case scenarios which often seem dramatic and over the top. I can see why people describe him as an alarmist, as he was spewing very depressing facts about the future of the earth and many people might not want to hear the disheartening news.
           <br><br>

I believe that taking an alarmist tone does risk the author alienating their audience that is not already aware of the ongoing climate change. The vast details Wallace-Wells included might shock readers and their first instinct is to reject the idea of our “perfect” earth quickly deteriorating. Frightening us into action might seem like the best way of getting people on the same page and working to slow down the effects of global warming. But in the case of climate change deniers and skeptics it is actually more harmful than beneficial to the cause.
           <br><br>

Wallace-Wells broke down some specific consequences to the ongoing climate change. I thought some of them seemed reasonable and could possibly come true within the end of the century. Others seemed to be pulled out of a dystopian film plot, such as perpetual war and climate plagues. I found the heat death as the most compelling, as we can already see changes in areas around the tropics and places with increasing intense heat. Soon places that were once flourishing cities will closely become inhabitable due to increasing temperatures and humidity.

The article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wells paints the image of our near future due to the consequences of human activity on the climate and well being of our Earth. He covers not only one aspect of the negative effects, but all of them; from air quality to causing perpetual wars. It was not the most optimistic article, but I feel that this alarming tone was needed to present to the readers how truly urgent this issue is. He makes it clear to the audience that if action is not taken soon then it will lead to the downfall of humanity as well as most of the life on earth. 
           <br><br>
 One of the things he said that I found most compelling was that he said people have been “engineering in ignorance” as people have known about the risks of climate change for decades but have chosen to ignore it or label it as a hoax. Even with international agreements to start reversing the damage such as the Paris agreement, not enough urgency is being credited to the matter and not enough actions are being taken. There are no repercussions or punishments if countries do not agree to follow the plan. Therefore, there is no real incentive to spend extra money to convert to renewable energies. This article provides a shocking revelation that if no action is taken then the millions of years it took to evolve to this perfect habitat will be ruined and unless the public believes this is a grave issue then governments will not make the changes needed.

The article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by  David Wallace Wells shows the inevitable future we will face if we do not begin to take responsibilities for our actions. It’s crazy when thinking about the climate crisis because everyone knows it’s an issue but they don’t really know how bad it’s getting or focus on fixing it as much as they should.  After reading it, I felt as if everyone should take action as soon as possible especially considering how rare it is to find a place like Earth that is capable of maintaining human life. In regards to being an alarmist, I argue that the only way to really get people out of their normal everyday routines and into wanting to make a change a bit of fear must be implemented in describing the climate crisis to illustrate what we are soon to encounter if no actions are made. People are aware that we are killing our planet yet fail to change their ways of living or protest for their governments to make a change which is something we should especially be doing in America after they left the Paris Agreement.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” is actually the first reading that I have read talks about the serious impacts that the climate change causes on our planet, not just simply rising sea level. After reading, I realized that our planet had been in danger as the result of human activities, and even was likely to become horrifically inhospitable.This reading concludes the likely consequences of our earth due to human activities, which are much more serious than we originally thought. It is an alarm to reminder human that if we were not control our activities and protect our planet, the climate change would eventually destroy the earth, the home of all human.
           <br><br>


Furthermore, the reading also points out that there are other factors which contributes the inadequate realization of serious consequences of climate change. The reading introduces scientific reticence, technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn’t even see warming as a problem worth addressing, which I didn’t know before. 
           <br><br>


All in all, this reading does excellent job to alarm human and motivates the people to take action to decrease the process of climate change and protect our planet.

I think that labeling people like David Wallace Wells as "alarmists" discredits realists who are trying to show people how real problems are. Alarmism is simply realism about what is going to happen. When you're in a building and you hear a fire alarm, everyone's natural instinct is to stop what they're doing and move to safety. Once safety is assured, those people can go back to what they were doing. Alarmists are attempting to get this same instinctual reaction out of people on a global scale through writing like this article. You read, you see the danger, and you stop what you're doing until safety is assured once again. This article sounds a louder alarm than most of its kind due to the enormous specificity of it. The article touches on several different consequences in depth, not just directly on the environment, but how the crisis will effect human interactions through the wars it will start and the economies it will destroy.
           <br><br>
However, I often react poorly to material like this and need to work to allow it to motivate me into action. The subject matter is dark and difficult to think about realistically. Reading about it in articles like this or watching a film often put me in a state of inaction because I begin thinking, "what's the point? People would rather die than change what they have." Through this inaction I become a hypocrite. Someone who wants to fight climate change and votes for it, but does not take all the personal steps I can. I'm not sure if that is my problem as a reader or if the people who create the content should be doing it in a way so that they provide this dark information and attempt to inspire at the same time, which is very difficult.

After reading the article “Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I felt a sensation of fear rush through my bones as it describes the possible doomsday climate scenarios on how the environment is going to be negatively affected due to human action. This fear that he has driven into the minds of his readers can either cause the individual to lose hope or to take action immediately. In my case, this article provoked me to seek ways in which I can contribute to saving the planet. I may not have the money, time, advanced technology or connections to directly investigate and greatly focus on the ways in which I can positively impact the planet but if everyone changes little things throughout their daily routine, it will create a huge impact in the long run.  David Wallace writes in a way that is truly thought-provoking in hopes that his words will inspire countries to keep their emissions low enough to obtain the affirmation goal of 1.5-2 degrees we long for in hopes of stopping extensive sea level rises.  
           <br><br>

The article is very uninspiring and negative as he acknowledges in extreme detail of what our world may potentially look like in the upcoming decades but I believe this approach is necessary because many individuals, including myself, may not fully understand how serious the climate will be impacted. Reading the detailed explanations allowed me to get a clear visualization of the horrifying truth. He may be an alarmist in the way of predicting all the potential causes of a mass extinction but in reality climate scientists have all the facts that directly align and support these scenarios. One thing that I found really interesting was when he stated the 4/5 mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gases. It is crazy to think that the cows that graze spend their  life polluting the climate with methane farts which is scary because I believe that the world will never get rid of cows or producing beef. 
           <br><br>

The one doomsday scenario that alarms me the most would be “Heat Death” because it is extremely saddening to know that several of the poorest countries will be getting hit with extreme heat. In the Middle East and Persian Gulf, the heat index in 2015 had temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit. That is completely insane to me! They don’t even have air conditioners and even with air conditioners, we would still be adding to the carbon problem. It sucks to read that one-fifth of the individuals in El Salvador are being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and dehydration from working in the field to keep their family up financially. 
           <br><br>

Overall, this article is a great way for individuals who are in doubt to take a step back and understand the true extent of climate change. It may be hard to convince individuals to make a change but hopefully this article motivates individuals to change this horrifying future.

In David Wallace’s “The Uninhabitable Earth”, the world is portrayed as a place that seems like Hell. The problem of the climate crisis and the slight change of a couple degrees in temperature seems like a world ending problem, with many conflicts arising because of this crisis. I believe that Wallace may have been a little too alarmist, yet I also feel as if it is necessary to show such drastic effects to prompt people into action. In fact, after reading this, I felt like I needed to act and will adopt lifestyle changes such as eating less meat and trying to drive less in order to lower gas emissions. I do believe that some people may dismiss this article as it seems like it is a little far fetched, but for the most part taking up this view is necessary to show how much the earth is changing and how much of a problem we have if we don’t act. My biggest concern out of the ones listed in the article would have to be the lack of food. I believe that droughts, storms, floods, etc could ruin our food supplies plus the addition of a rising population would leave many people out to starve. Food has a finite number on this earth and many people are already living in poverty and living hungry, so an increase in people and a decrease in food would be a major problem on this planet. This article should scare many people into action as these sources and these problems are very real. Now I did think that I knew many of the problems that came without this crisis before reading this, yet after I realized I only knew a few. Furthermore, the fact that some of the effects of the climate crisis will later increase the crisis is also very scary since it means the more it proceeds the more screwed the planet is. I really hope people will start to take this more seriously since if we don’t, many terrible things could happen such as what was listed in the article.

When I first started reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I was upset that the author decided to use alarmist activism, describing our situation as “worse than you think.” I dislike this (quite common) use of negative appeal for persuasion; I recently learned from one of Sarah Jacquette Ray’s lectures at UCSB that negative emotional appeal in news/media coverage (and the like) of climate change is more likely to discourage people from working towards saving the planet, rather than encouraging them to push forward. 
           <br><br>
However, having read the rest of the article, I appreciate the extra information--much of which I have never learned about before. Though I do not particularly know how these new details could help with my personal environmental efforts today or in the near future, I think they enhance the idea that everything is much more complicated than it seems. This concept in itself is definitely one of the reasons why I was originally discouraged from tackling environmental issues head-on through the environmental studies major. At the same time, I do appreciate having extra knowledge on how climate change is already happening and its effects, including direct heat deaths, smog, and growing ocean dead zones. It hurt when I realized that just extremely hot temperatures already exist and have been killing thousands of people. The more I know about the consequences of carbon emissions, the more I feel guilty and paralyzed in my everyday life, from each item I see thrown into the trash to each plastic item I see in a convenience store. I read this article while I was feeling pretty sleepy, but had my eyes wide open reading these depressing facts. The ending note on how some climatologists are working to prevent worse events were not very assuring.

David Wallace-Wells portrays the immediate need for a call to action to prevent catastrophic events from destroying most of life on earth. While this may be deemed unnecessarily alarming, it’s actually adequately so. Wallace-Wells understands that climate change is no quick and easy fix to be put off until absolutely necessary, but as a long, difficult task that must be started now in order to prevent the continuation of a mass extinction. Wallace-Wells includes statistics and relates them to the past, present, and future while also creating a more understandable scale in which these numbers can be understood to the non-scientist reader. His urgent tone is effective in urging the reader to not only be aware of what’s happening, but to be deeply concerned about a ghastly future that lays within their lifespan. 

           <br><br>

The most compelling argument within his article was Climate Plagues. People today have seen how quickly disease can spread and kill, such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 80s and even as small as a minor Ebola outbreak in the US in 2016 which caused massive panic. Plague is a haunting and terrifying reality, especially with known viruses that our bodies cannot fend against. With these viruses being released from the thawing ice, combined with their ability to multiply incredibly fast and spread from population to population, this tragic prediction is a much quicker road to death than anything else mentioned.

After reading the article I felt very anxious and as if the world was going to end very soon, maybe even in my life time. Initially I thought that the big issue was rising sea levels that would destroy places like Florida. I wasn’t informed on the other major issues that could possibly affect the Earth including the melting of Arctic permafrost which would releases carbon that could then evaporate into methane causing hotter temperatures around the earth or the issue of hotter temperature destroying crops. Reading through all these issues made me feel helpless and as if there was nothing I could do to fix these major problems. Now that I am contemplating on these problems and how the article made me feel I think that Wallace-Wells idea was to create an article that would make people feel as if the end of the world was tomorrow. I believe he may be too alarmist in his approach and understand after watching Professor Hiltner commentary on the article that we have much more time than earlier thought.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth," I've come to realize that the consequences listed in the article are not just independent effects that will result from climate change, but are rather individual parts of an interconnected system that almost acts as a feedback loop. For example, the intense heating that will occur will not only directly kill billions of people, but that heat will, in turn, cause water molecules in the ocean to expand and flood coastal cities (killing millions more in the process). These impacts, including others like lethally acidic oceans and methane emissions from permafrost melting, will all act in accordance with one another to produce an apocalypse-type scenario that will likely kill the majority of the Earth's population.

I think the most terrifying part of this article is the fact that these consequences are not the result of a worst-case-scenario, but rather the result of the current trajectory that we are already facing (business as usual). This just goes to show that if we do not act soon, we risk losing countless lives to something that could have been completely preventable, had everybody listened to the warnings that have been given countless times. The main reason for denying climate change seems to be simple: some would rather not give up their comfortable lifestyles and personal liberties. On paper, this seems reasonable: each human is born with individual liberties that shall not be infringed upon by any means necessary. But in reality, we are rapidly approaching a world that will not allow these liberties to be exercised...we will be fighting purely for survival just as humans did tens of thousands of years ago. These privileges must be curbed in some way to help create a more sustainable world, or else we will inevitably face the consequences listed in Wallace-Wells' piece.

I greatly enjoyed reading David Wallace-Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth." I already know a good deal about the climate crisis, so I was skeptical that the article would teach me anything significantly new. I was wrong on this account. Wallace-Wells laid down some harsh truths that I simply did not know of before or that I had not thought of in a while. I proudly call myself a climate activist and the climate crisis is the issue I am most concerned about; however, it is still important to be reminded of the specific details of the climate crisis in order to gain fresh eyes and a new perspective on the issue. I also greatly appreciate how Wallace-Wells really addressed the human aspect of the climate crisis. It is easy for people to see the climate crisis as an issue that will not affect their lives. The same talks of temperature increase, sea level rise, and dying polar bears doesn't really inspire change in most people. Part of this is because to most people, the temperature rising a few degrees and the sea level rising a few feet does not seem that catastrophic--I believe this is because people do not know what extreme consequences that slight temperature or sea level increase will cause. By highlighting how impactful the climate crisis will be on all aspects of life (and especially focusing on the dire consequences of poorer nations, like Bangladesh), Wallace-Wells really brings the issue to the front of people's minds. 
           <br><br>

This brings me to comments about the alarmist perspective that Wallace-Wells takes. While I understand that this tone is extremely frightening, I think that Wallace-Wells is completely justified in taking this approach because causing people to be extremely frightened is exactly the point. Especially with a problem of such size and magnitude, it is easy for people to put off the problem and simply ignore it is happening. But it is very difficult to ignore the extremity of the situation with the alarmist tone that Wallace-Wells takes. I also think that discussing the climate crisis in a tone other than that of extreme worry and fear would be doing a great injustice to all the communities that are currently being negatively affected by the crisis. It is only right to be discussing the next mass extinction (if nothing is done to solve the problem) with such alarm.

Not going to lie reading the article was a genuine shock for me. As a 3rd year ES student, I am definitely aware of the current state of our environment as well as the lack of action from the US government to act and attempt to remedy the situation. However, this is one of the first few articles that outright listed the different effects in one article for consumption and it is a lot. It is slightly bleak that there are so many effects that lead to destruction but it also warrants action. I thought the fact that this article mentioned the focus on rising sea levels in mainstream media and how realistically there are so many more pressing and scary issues that come along with it including an economic collapse and rise in natural disasters. This along with climate change incites an entire butterfly effect of consequences. One of the most prominent of these effects is the amount of disease and greenhouse gasses currently trapped in the cold reaches of the poles. If the temperature were to continue rising then all of these things would run rampant on our Earth. On a positive note, I thought the mention of engineering to clear our atmosphere of carbon emissions was an interesting way to solve this problem. Yes, it is expensive but at the same time if it could help it’s worth looking into.

I was shocked by the article “ The Uninhabitable Earth” written by David Wallace-Wells. Before reading this article, I think I am well informed about climate change. I know global warming is occurring, the sea level is rising, and extreme weather is happening more frequently, and all of these are the impacts of climate change, but I never realized how severe is this situation until I read this article. Wells describes what the earth would be like if we don’t take action to solve climate change. For example, the earth would become too hot for humans and animals to live, the food production will be sharply reduced, and we will face many other crucial problems such as climate plagues, unbreathable air, perpetual war, economic collapse, and poisoned oceans. This article is a warning that tells us we need to do something immediately and quickly, otherwise, we will lose our inhabitable earth forever. In my opinion, Wells’s attitude on climate change is not too alarmist, and I believe it is necessary to use approaches that instill fear to inform and motivate people. In the article, Wells writes about the worst consequences of climate change which can actually make people more engaged. From the perspective of psychology, fear is the best tool to get people’s attention and force them to act. Overall, after reading this article, I feel more informed about the consequences of climate change and prompted to action.

I’ve been hearing people saying that the scientists are exaggerating the facts of climate change and environmental issues on our planet to “terrify” us for a long time; I don’t agree with this idea but I think it’s understandable for people to think like this because most of us rarely get to see or experience the evidence that introduced in the video in our daily life. Wallace-Wells used the word “doomsday” as the title of the first part of his article. This actually scared me, and I doubted whether the fact was as severe as the definition of this word. As going through all the information he provided, I got convinced by him, which means I don’t think he’s an alarmist. Just like I said, many people may not pay that much attention to slight climate changes, such as a few degrees temperatures increasing in summer or a few percentages of ice cover dropping taking place every year. However, we can still find the unusual things if we think about the heat-death accidents in the past few years around the world or the wildfires taking place in California all most every fall. As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think I had heard about this much news about heat-death or severe wildfires fifteen years ago, when I was way younger. Hence, the climate on our planet is changing, in a bad way. 
           <br><br>

I agree that human activity is a huge cause of the rapid climate change taking place in this decade. As Wallace-Wells wrote in his article, we have poisoned the sea and emitted a ton of CO2 into the atmosphere. When I heard five billions of CO2 have got into the atmosphere, I was totally shocked. Unfortunately, most people are not aware of how severe this condition is because it seems has no effect on our normal daily life. 
           <br><br>

In order to prevent the condition from getting worse, the governments really need to do something, either educate people or whatever ways they can do to get people to know about the fact and how terrible to consequence would be is we don't make any efforts on it.



</p><hr>


<p>
The uninhabitable earth paints a dire picture of what is to come in the coming decades, describing how cities will drown and millions if not billions of people will die, leaving us without a home. There was a point, several decades again, where we could have successfully reversed the effects of climate change and have healthy, successful lives today. But we have very nearly reached that point of no return – there is likely no sure future for the generation after us, a case frustratingly made difficult to solve by stonewalled politics. 
           <br><br>

Most people, as David Wallace-Wells points out, cannot begin to comprehend what is to come, only looking at what is in the present moment. It brings a helpless feeling of “doomsday,” as he notes; a feeling that brings horror and worry to all that read his article.

When reading David Wallace Well's article, it didn't feel all that "alarmist" to me. For me it felt entirely factual and not like a warning about a future that could happen, but rather what is happening right now. There were so many consequences to the climate crisis that I had never heard of before, which felt surprising since I felt like I had a lot of knowledge on the subject. The one that surprised me the most was the threat of the bubonic iceberg and the ancient deadly diseases that it carries. I had never heard of our ice caps carrying centuries old diseases, and it came as a shock to me that this was already occurring in places where permafrost is exposing dead animals. Not only that but I was also surprised by how close we are to impending doom, it seems as if we are spiraling out of control, straight towards our self destruction. This article really sparked a call to action in me, and I felt pretty angry after reading it. I feels like a betrayal to know that we could be taking action to drastically reduce the harm we've done to the planet, and yet there is so little being done because of the interests of the few. I felt inspired to take control of my own environmental habits; however it feels futile in comparison to the harmful effects of the oil industry and other big polluters.

           <br><br>

I feel like there is more risk in trying to put the climate crisis delicately, rather than the alarmist take of Wallace Wells. I think that people need to be scared for our future, because it sometimes feels like the climate crisis wont harm us in our lifetime. The reality is that it is happening now though, and we should be alarmed. I think the risk of being too alarmist is small in comparison to not letting everyone know just how serious the issue is.

Despite having read David Wallace-Wells’ article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, many times before, I am still always taken aback by the severity of Earth’s current climate crisis. Wells thoroughly depicts the most pressing issues of climate change, many of which are overlooked by society. However, Wells’ choice to take an alarmist approach in order to instigate action had the opposite effect on many people. After reading the article many readers, along with myself, felt slightly dejected and not very hopeful for the future. An example of this was in Wells’ explanation of climate plagues. His sources estimated that, “by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with”, Malaria. This statement was enough to strike fear into the readers and without offering any real solutions, this estimate is a terrifying reality. Many of Wallace-Wells’ points followed the same formula: introduction to a new effect of climate change, hard-hitting scientific data, and the conclusion that a continuation of this will result in catastrophic, irreversible events. I am by no means ignorant to our world’s current crisis, but at the same time, reading articles that offer little to no solutions does very little to move me to action. 
           <br><br>


The most engaging part of the article was the end of “The Great Filter”. In this part, Wells introduces some of the first scientists to identify and work towards solving climate change. For the first time, the article takes on a slightly hopeful outlook. He mentions the different solutions these scientists have been working towards for their whole careers and some victories they have achieved. Despite the fact that all of the scientists have quite negative outlooks on Earth’s current climatic situation, they all have seemingly optimistic views for the future. The inclusion of these commentaries are a nice change of pace for the article. Even though the scientists provide the very non committal solution of halting climate change simply, “...because we must”, this is still enough to ease some of the tensions readers accumulated while reading all the negatives listed in the article. While I do not necessarily agree with Wells’ alarmist approach to his climate change article, I do commend him for taking action and informing the public of our, currently grim, future.

In David Wallace-Wells’ article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I found that I particularly resonated with the section called “Poisoned Oceans” due to the fact that I would like to work in marine biology and marine conservation in the future. With the way human effort towards climate change is going, it truly is inevitable that we will not only lose coastal cities, and thus important economies and ports, but also suffer mass marine ecological loss. Rising temperatures cause the large swaths of Arctic sea ice to melt, effectively rising sea levels to the point where cities like Miami will be completely swallowed by water. This would lead to the immediate displacement of hundreds of million of people, and worldwide economic, social, and political effects would reverberate as time goes on. Additionally, as the oceans store more and more influxes of carbon, the water becomes more acidic, completely throwing marine ecosystems off-kilter and leading to consequences such as coral bleaching, which would devastate humans and animals alike. 
           <br><br>

This portion of the article made me face a lot of the questions that I had always kept in the back of mind for as long as I could remember- what if there really isn’t a way to help nurture dying reefs? What if there really is no way to negate the already vile effects humans have caused on our oceans? What if by the time I’m able to study our oceans and the life within them, there isn’t anything to study left because the ecosystems are so destroyed? It’s a stark reminder to the reality that our generation is left with to tackle. Because of this, I would agree that Wells took an alarmist position, but it’s a position that’s needed for the general population to understand what’s happening. He doesn’t beat around the bush when it comes to what will happen as a result of climate change, and I think that no-frills way of presenting scientific data is what people need.

The effects of climate change have already begun to affect the earth in ways already described within Wallace’s article: harsher and longer-lasting hurricanes, rising extinction numbers, polluted airs, rise in global relation conflicts, etc. Although Wallace’s article can have the effect of inciting fear onto his readers, the purpose of his article was to inform his audience of the potential outcomes that could happen if the issue on climate change continues to be ignored. At the end of his article, Wallace reaffirmed that scientists have come up with possible solutions to climate crises yet would create smaller issues afterwards, such as the aerosol approach. Wallace is not an alarmist because many of his claims of what could happen in the future has already started to happen.
           <br><br>
After reading his article, I felt fearful of what is to come in the next few years, yet galvanized to even try to minimize the full consequences that climate change will bring. Having fear after reading Wallace’s article is understandable as many do not know the implications climate change has already had on the earth. Based on factual evidence that has been released by credible scientists since the mid-late 20th century on the implications of climate change alone should be reason to consider his claims on what the future can hold for us and disregard him as an alarmist. If he is an alarmist, why would it be so wrong to turn to renewable energy, to care for our oceans and forests undergoing acidification and forest fires, or just hold our living standards to a much cleaner quality? Although there are many reasons to be frightful, Wallace informs us these outcomes have only started to happen and will only continue if we continue on the pace of ignorance. 
           <br><br>
From his article, Heat Death was definitely the most compelling to me as I was born in the Imperial Valley Desert where temperatures can go as high as 120 during the summer. During those hot summer days, it is difficult for me to stay outside for longer than an hour. Knowing that temperatures are rising more this decade made it more realistic to me that many places on earth will in fact become uninhabitable at the turn of the century, regardless of what is done by humanity to reduce the consequences.



</p><hr>



<p>
Before I started to read “The uninhabitable Earth”, I’ve read so many articles which were written by some alarmists. I think I have learned enough about the environmental problems on the earth. It was my opinion that the world has paid enough attention to environmental issues, people are already working to solve these problems, and we don't need to invest more time and money. However, it is not. One problem often causes many new problems. The author of this article lists many economic and political issues caused by global warming that I have never considered. It's like a chain reaction. If people do not control the problem, it will bring some new social problems to this world in a short time and destroy the living environment of all lives.

<p>
As much as I like to think I’m quite adequately educated about the dire impacts that could be brought on by climate change, “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells truly opened my eyes to so many possible consequences that I, along with so many other people in this world, have been unaware of. Some of the consequences Wallace-Wells brought up were obvious to me, like food becoming a scarcity and some areas becoming too warm to be a stable habitat for humans. Other consequences he mentioned, though, sounded as if they came straight from a horror movie: old diseases being released after the ice that’s been trapping them starts melting, a decrease in breathable air, and even hydrogen sulfide infected oceans. The scariest part is that we’re not very far away from seeing some of these “futures” become a reality; some of them already are (e.g., a stretch of land called “Skeleton Coast” where hydrogen sulfide can already be found in its ocean). Our Earth’s population is truly not grasping how close we really are to essentially destroying ourselves. 

           <br><br>

Some would call Wallace-Wells an alarmist, and I can’t completely disagree. I wouldn’t consider being an alarmist a bad thing necessarily though in this case; we do need to be alarmed! As said in the article, multiple scientists have agreed that emission reductions of fossil fuels alone is likely not enough to get us out of the hole we’ve dug ourselves into. Now is the time to change, yet no one sees the urgency to do it. The United States even made backwards progress by pulling out of the Paris Agreement, a deal made by numerous countries to try to keep the global temperature from rising more than 1.5°C, despite being second only to China in greenhouse gas emissions. In my opinion, the issue of climate change will struggle to grasp the attention of the whole world until a severely drastic and devastating event occurs that can be blamed purely on global warming; and at that point, it’ll likely be too late.



</p><hr>



<p>
To be honest, I have never expected such a significant climate change caused by greenhouse gases. It is hard to believe several degrees warming in North or South poles, which could lead to a death of animals living there. It is a pity that icebergs are disappearing and sea level is increasing so fast that many countries or cities could be drown. Take one of my favorite places as an example—Maldives. In 2010, when I go there for the first time, local people said there is only about 100 years left for Maldives. However, in 2019, I go there again, I was told there are only about 45 to 50 years left. It is hard for me to imagine what exactly has caused a twice speed of warming. But I do know serious actions should be taken against pollutions.



</p><hr>



<p>
Although I was aware of the climate change and its possible global outcomes, I didn’t realize how catastrophic the consequences could be on the earth and on all species living on this planet. I became somehow pessimistic after reading “The uninhabitable earth”. Referring to the knowledge that I already had on the climate crisis, I actually could resonate some of the facts that are already taking place with the sort of “predictions” presented by David Wallace-Wells. These facts such as the global sea-level rise and intensifying hurricane activities are the indisputable proof of the tragedies caused by global warming. Yet I couldn’t be more pessimistic about the future of mankind when those entities or persons actually deny the existence of global warming due to their personal interests.
           <br><br>

It has been said that the Paris Agreement is, without doubt, a global agreement signed by the most countries in the globe throughout human history. However, as professor Hiltner mentioned in lectures, there are no enforcement actions on each country’s reduction in carbon emission. Things hence became worse with the U.S withdrawal from the agreement, and this is really upset for the human race since U.S is the second-largest carbon emitter on the globe. Moreover, giving that 2/3 of the 1.5-degree Celcius goal set by the Paris Agreement has been achieved. And if we do not take serious actions, it is likely that our 2-degree increase in global temperature will be achieved in just a few decades. Noting that Professor Hiltner said in his lecture that the existing 1 degree of increase in global temperature has already caused serious problems, the influence of a 2-degree increase or even 4-degree increase in global temperature would be more profound and catastrophic. 
           <br><br>

Personally speaking, David Wallace-Well's effort in arousing our attention on the global climate crisis is pretty effective through the presenting of "scary" outcomes of a 4-degree increase in the world temperature. Some of the consequences such as perpetuating war and heat death that causes species to die out are applicable to the current global society as history has already taught us lessons on these issues. We as a new contributing generation to the global crisis must do something to guarantee the future of mankind and stop denying the global climate crisis.

This article was very eye opening and interesting. Prior to reading this article I had no clue how threatening global warming was. I had a general idea that it was definitely damaging our planet but I had no clue how severe the problem was. In fact other than the melting of the ice caps and the rise in sea level I didn't know global warming was going to have any other effects. However, even if the effects ended with sea level rise and the melting of the ice caps, humans would be in a terrible position regardless. It really surprised be how many other serious effects there are as a result of just a small increase in global temperature. In addition to learning these more serious effects, this article really put this whole crisis into perspective for me. I had no clue how damaging our daily lives are to the environment. I mean, I had a general idea but I was clueless about how serious the damage was. The article really shocked me when I read the fact about long distance round trip plane rides and the amount of ice that is lost for each trip. I was also amazed to learn the amount of people that will be displaced by a 10 meter sea level rise. 

           <br><br>

Furthermore, I think Wallace is effective by using the alarmist attitude that he chooses to use in his article. This is a very serious problem and fear should be evoked when discussing its implications. Like Broecker, I personally hope that we can develop carbon capture because I find it hard to believe that people are just going to all the sudden change their lifestyles out of the blue. Unfortunately we live in an era where many people tend to procrastinate until the effects are right in front of their eyes. What I mean by this is that I believe the majority of people aren't going to take action until it is way to late and we are in serious danger.

When facing human interventions, some lives are extremely fragile that would beyond our imagination. More evidence shows that climate change affected every aspect of the earth. In millions of years of history, animals lived in their habitats safely, but the industrial revolution has changed it all. The world has changed so fast that even with places as far as the Antarctic and the Arctic are inevitably involved in the whirlpool of climate change. There are so many terrifying things happened in the past several years. Wallace-Wells in his article The Uninhabitable Earth mentioning how would climate change affect our earth. Wallace writes from the permafrost virus to human health problems, from agriculture issues to future wars between countries. 
           <br><br>

I’m shocked reading Wallace’s article, and it is the first time I feel that climate change is such an urgent thing that we need to take action now. Wallace gives a lot of data in his article, and he intuitively shows us the actual consequences of climate change. Sometimes people feel that climate change is far away from them, and Wallace gives his answer to show that climate change is so close to us now. He gives examples like earth has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat, and there are 20 million people might be killed this year because of the extreme heat, moreover, there are more than 10000 people die each day from fossil-fuel burning; 3390 people die from wildfire smoke; a third of deaths in China were caused by smog; I can’t describe how sad I am to know about these facts. Those data above are not just cold numbers, they were once lively human beings, had normal lives like you and me, but their lives were taken by the serious consequences of what people had done in the past years. More than human ourselves, creatures like coral reefs are rapidly declining at an alarming rate; permafrost is melting, releasing thousands of fatal viruses; ocean is about to flood coastal cities; Wallace’s article made me realize that we should act now to protect the earth and not wait until we don't know how to turn it around.

It gets a little terrifying when reading back to back unfortunate things that’ll happen in our life span “schedule” - but it’s also one hell of an eye-opener. Wallace-Wells cleverly states and informs his audience with all the possible outcomes at the end of this climate crisis and supports it with so much evidence I would’ve never even thought of looking into. The most interesting part of the article for me was learning about the viruses and all the CO2 that’s actually buried underneath all the ice sheets and around the world. It’s a huge slap to the face because I think not many people are aware of all the dangers that aren’t coming- but are already here and right under our feet. 
           <br><br>
Personally, after reading this, I take this crisis more seriously because I never really knew what dangers there were. I knew the planet was warming and the ice caps were melting but I never really thought of how much it would affect not only me, but the rest of the world. It’s like discovering a whole different world is right under you and now you have to fight for it not to get out. Then Wallace explains every single way it’s affecting the planet and it then feels like you have so many worlds to fight in order to save this planet - and that’s how it should feel because we’re not only fighting for Earth but we’re fighting for our literal lives.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I felt very nervous for the future of out planet. I believe that his urging tone did both prompt me into action and inaction. When I finished the article I felt a sense of doom and just sat there, but in the long run I will think of how my actions can prevent what happens in our future. I knew about climate change but I did not realize the amount of affects it had attached to it. To me the most compelling circumstance was “heat death”. I realized that the climate is warming, but did not know that one fifth of the people in El Salvador and other regions have diseases from working in these conditions. Another compelling aspect that I have been thinking about is if sea levels keep rising, what will happen to UCSB? Hopefully we can stop the change and will not have to know.

I think a lot of people are like you in the sense that they feel a sense of both inaction and action. Personally, right after watching a film about climate change I also feel a sense of doom and don't know what to do with myself. After that goes away I feel so motivated to make a difference, but after a day or two that feeling fades away and I go back to my daily life. I think it would be really helpful if we were able to make more films and advertising that were as in your face as regular advertising for products. If even a small fraction of the advertising we see every day was informative about climate change, it would subconsciously be in the back of people's heads, and I think it would actually make a difference. The tactics that advertisers use to make us buy products can be used to make people more aware of their decisions and the issues facing our Earth. We need to make people realize this is not just an issue that other people are going to deal with, its something that is going to affect everybody.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was an astonishing and informative read. In contrast to many other articles concerning the climate crisis, Wallace-Wells paints a harsh reality of unavoidable catastrophic consequences. In truth, the rhetoric surrounding climate change today has seen the rise of multiple narratives over the past decade. With so many diverse perspectives, many which contrast one another, it is often difficult to try and make sense of what is fact and what is fiction. Wallace-Wells’ “alarmist” perspective on the climate crisis seems to purposefully incite feelings of fear, panic, and distress in readers but I believe that a certain degree of pessimism is justified when it comes to the climate crisis. 
           <br><br>

With all that said, I appreciated how specific the author was in detailing the consequences of climate change beyond the usual generalities of economic peril and the rising sea level. Furthermore, he also made a point of how the effects of climate change aren’t universal. Different species, societies, countries, and social classes may be affected differently. For example, if climate change continues at its current rate, Bangladesh will face dire consequences. And of course, coastal cities will be particularly affected. But at the end of the day, climate change is an immediate global problem and it should be treated as such. Therefore, one cannot help but appreciate how David Wallace-Wells has no qualms about stating the bitter truth. Given the fact that some individuals still deny the existence of climate change entirely, it is clear that more people need to speak out against the status quo. This is everyone’s fight and everyone’s problem.

Before I began reading this article I thought I knew what I was going to be reading about but the further I got into the text, I noticed myself becoming more surprised and also terrified for the future. The article "The Uninhabitable (or at least unwelcoming ) Earth" by Davide Wallace- Wells lays out the detrimental effects of climate change that are not only going to affect humans but literally every living species on the planet. We have seen how in the past the warming of the planet released methane which led to one of the biggest extinctions of Earth, killing 97% of species that inhabited the Earth. He gives us insight as to what the future is going to look like if we continue to do what we are doing and refuse to acknowledge our carbon footprint. Some of the things he points out that we can expect in the future if there is not a change is starvation as food will no longer be easily grown due to harsh weather conditions, fighting/ war, heat waves and crazy/ extreme weather like we have never seen before.

I thought this article touched on all the points that make the climate crisis what it is today. Moreover, unlike other articles that just inform the readers of the possible consequences of the ongoing climate change and tell us to eat less meat, this one actually describes the processes that are going on in the world and how to prevent them from turning our planet into a so-called "war machine" that will destroy our life as we know it.

           <br><br>

Even though I already knew that the people who are going to suffer the most from this issue are the ones who contributed the least to it, this article made me realize the whole scale of such an event. Places like Bangladesh and other countries in Middle Asia and in tropical areas have already started to feel the effects of climate change, and their lives from now on are just going to get even harder. For example, malaria, which will soon move to Europe because of the rising temperatures there, will start affecting more and more people. This becomes even more alarming when I realize how much time people actually have left and how much resources are being put into the search of the right solution that can help prevent the harsh consequences of climate change on innocent people that potentially could lose their homes, health, and access to food.

Regarding David Wallace Wells “The Uninhabitable Earth”, to say the very least I was deeply concerned by what I read. I found the presentation of his concerns to be relatively easy to follow and digest despite the concerning content each section disclosed, making the passage overall very informative and valuable. I found it slightly shocking that Wells received heavy criticism for being a climate alarmist because- the fact of the matter is that such effects that would result from a 2-4 degree Celsius increase in temperature are undoubtedly alarming and no level of concern seems like too much to me. His tone may be able to be classified as alarmist but the real question is, is that an issue considering the current state we find ourselves in? I think that the criticism he receives for his alarmist attitude are redundant considering his goal was to focus people’s attention on this major issue and shake them to action that should have begun years ago. Truely, I think this level of worry and prediction is necessary by all means. This is a fair assessment considering there has already been a 2/3rds rise or rather 1 degree increase, meaning such an increase as 2-4 degrees is looking likely. For anyone doubting this matter and considering the nature of Wells article as alarmist I would recommend to them the annotated version of this article because the content it further refutes the idea that affects such as the ones outlined in Well’s article.
           <br><br>

Considering the actual content of the article I found the majority of the sections to be alarming. He was right in the fact that I really didn't know just how bad it is and how bad things will get. There were certain consequences I've never even imagined, such as the mutated disease and epidemic section. The fact that we are already seeing the effects of this when looking at the Zika Virus is deeply concerning. Another thing I learned from this article that shocked me was that as the permafrost ice contains continues to melt that more and more carbon will be released. Originally I thought rising sea levels were the effects of the ice melting, but this double threat of the emissions was shocking to me. I find that Well’s has sufficient support for each of his claims and has considered the many variables humanity would face in the events of such a temperature increase, and to say the least I am incredibly more scared than before- and that’s saying a lot considering I thought I was informed on the subject. I now realize how ignorant I am to the true scale of this issue, and this makes me wonder about the rest of our population. I was relieved to hear that they are optimistic, and I too hope for the best for humanity, and deeply wish people will come to action once they reallize the error of our ways. This is hard though considering the bleak reality of things.

The article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells informs the reader of the current catastrophic climate conditions in hopes of inspiring people to make immediate changes. He touches on several environmental concerns, emphasizing the decline in air quality, soil quality, and the overall warming of our planet. Maintaining air and soil quality is essential to sustaining earth and all its organisms. He is very bold in his claims, but he is right to state these alarming facts. While many believe he is exaggerating, I believe that his claims are well supported and represent the current climate crisis. Humans have prioritized industrialization for far too long, and the future of the planet is in jeopardy. 
           <br><br>

The most alarming point Wells brings up is the poor air quality that currently exists. The current amount of carbon dioxide in the air has surpassed 400 ppm, and is expected to hit 1000 ppm by 2100. It is insane that in 80 years, we will hit more than double the current level of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. We are already at a very dangerous level of carbon dioxide, and the effects have already been reflected in our declining environmental conditions. Wells says that we will literally begin "suffocating" if we ignore the problems at hand. 
           <br><br>

The current environmental conditions are shocking, and we need to take immediate action to ensure that earth will be sustainable for future generations.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was the first article on climate change that not only sparked my interest, but also motivated me to act on my anger. Wallace-Wells outlined the issues of climate change in a way that anyone could understand, while still making his concerns heard and detailed. His concerns detailed under “Doomsday” were very relevant, as many people don’t understand the severity of climate change and therefore have a hard time imagining the consequences. His note that out of all of our extinctions, all but one has been caused from greenhouses is alarming and calls for immediate action. While I like to think that I have been aware of the growing issues surrounding climate change, I have been using my privilege to ignore the environmental problems many are already facing. Wallace-Wells mentions that the world will lose Miami and Bangladesh within the century, which is completely astounding and makes me question why more people in power aren’t doing anything about this crisis. 
           <br><br>
I believe his most compelling section was the section “Perpetual War”. As a Political Science major, I am curious about foreign relations and what drives international war. His comment that with every half degree of warming increase, the likelihood of armed conflict rises 10-20% is shocking and extremely worrisome. Crop failure, forced migration, and overall irritability can all topple our international system. Looking at climate change from a political view has strengthened my new passion for environmental issues that affect people all over the world. 
           <br><br>
Lastly, I do not believe David Wallace-Wells is too alarmist. He is effective in communicating the altercations of climate change. As a society we are too relaxed in how we view climate change and we need to feel fear, otherwise we won’t make a change. While he does risk alienating some readers when using this perspective, I strongly believe it is better to take climate change seriously, rather than not at all. He lays out all the issues surrounding climate change and while he doesn’t present the readers with solutions, he does end on a rather optimistic note, stating that humans are ingenious with solutions.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” written by David Wallace was my first time reading about the consequences of the climate crisis that is happening in our planet. It is eye opening, I never knew how much will be affected by climate change. It is scary knowing that the oceans can become poisonous and that  human cognitive ability can decline by 21%. David Wallace does not deserve any of the hate he gets just because he decided to write down our future before we experience it. After reading this text it really got me thinking that our lives our gonna change so much during this century, we are gonna have to take care of  a 4.543 billion year planet. This is a lot of pressure for this and the next generation. I am glad that David Wallace took up the courage to inform us about the problems we can potentially face.

Climate change is an undeniable force in today’s world, yet there is a much too large population of people who deny it as true. In Wallace-Wells’ alarming article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, very horrific, shocking, and upsettingly accurate consequences of climate change are described. For those who acknowledge climate change as factual, Wallace’s alarmist view justifies the severity of the situation and has the power to drive people to action in the fight against climate change. For some populations of people, however, this alarmist view frightens to the point where it is easier to simply not think about climate change at all. This in itself is alarming because the people who refuse to think about climate change or deny it as factual have no interest in assisting to solve this urgent issue. While I find this article horrifyingly captivating, a lot of people may see this as just too terrible to be true or to believe, so Wallace risks crippling people with fear. One particular part where I was very close to being crippled by fear was the section of the article that spoke of perpetual war. Hearing that there is a link between degrees of warming and an increased likelihood of war made me feel momentarily hopeless because climate change is a global issue. With increased conflict between countries, there is even less of a chance for unification between nations to fight against climate change. 

           <br><br>

After reading this article, I had the urge to spread awareness to others. I wanted to share this reading with climate change deniers and try to make them see the dangers. Though this was my reaction, I know climate change deniers who did read the article are at risk of being alienated. While an alarmist approach is capable of shocking people into action quickly, it also has the ability to isolate people from the climate crisis completely so it is important to also instill hope for the future. It is important to let people know that though the earth is in danger, it is still worth trying to save. Even though this is an approach I believe could assist in gaining the acceptance of those who deny climate change, Wallace’s approach was definitely productive as far as getting me to want to take action. Wallace is an alarmist, but this is rightfully so. The climate crisis is urgent; Wallace is stating facts about the future of our earth and if that makes you scared, it’s because you should be.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells paints a terrifying and looming reality for humanity and all life on the planet. Manmade climate change has repercussions that will drastically change the face of the Earth if left unchecked. Through environmental studies and other news sources, I’ve learned about manmade climate change and much of what it would entail for humanity in the coming years, but I had never thought of these issues in such extreme and upcoming terms as presented in this article. Climate change, although a pressing issue, seemed less tangible to me than other environmental issues such as habitat loss and plastic pollution. As David Wallace-Wells describes in “The Great Filter” section of his work, people have trouble comprehending the full scope of the negative effect of our actions because we live in a society that has been trained to believe that innovation will always have a solution and the economy can keep growing boundless despite the limited resources here on the Earth. Even in fiction, works focus on the “journey of an individual conscience rather than the poisonous miasma of social fate.” We are not used to viewing our society in such bleak terms, let alone humanity as a whole. This alarmist point of view is necessary as it serves as a call to action working to emphasize how drastic our current situation is and how important it is that we make changes now. This being said, this cannot be the only point of view on climate change being shared. It is crucial that there are people covering what is being done to mitigate climate change and prevent this very plausible outcome. After this reading, I felt like there wasn’t enough time for me to make as much of a difference as I would like to. It has already been three years since the article was released and, at least in the US, things don’t seem to be changing. What little changes have come about (less plastic straws, more vegetarians, and the like) are not nearly drastic enough to slow climate change at its current pace. While this sense of urgency is good for inspiring action sooner rather than later, it does not make the reader feel as if their actions alone could be enough to stop the bleak future that is painted in this article. It would be like fighting a hurricane with a sword. There are so many contributors to climate change, the list of actions that could help to reverse these practices and effects is endless, and therefore every little thing counts.

I was most compelled by David Wallace-Wells’ description of oceans warming and ocean acidification. Oceans cover 70% of the Earth’s surface, and the thought of dead waters throughout that vast expanse of water is a terrifying thought. Oceans are taking the brunt of anthropogenic emissions, and because of it, much of the life within our oceans are suffering or will be in the near future. These animals and plants do not have enough time to adapt to the higher temperatures and/or increasing acidity. This was especially scary to me because the oceans are so important and so full of life, it’s horrifying to think that our mindless pollution of this Earth will effect those massive waters so thoroughly. 
           <br><br>

All life is connected on this Earth and as we destroy life, we inevitably destroy ourselves. Our society needs to take responsibility for anthropogenic climate change, and then take the necessary actions to mitigate these issues.

Wallace-Wells’ article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, describes some of the severe consequences that could possibly result from climate change if no action is taken. Unlike the way that global warming is commonly portrayed in politics and the media, Wallace-Wells’ does not sugar-coat over the severity of the situation. While this approach may seem alarmist to some, I believe that it is necessary in order to inspire any real change. Wallace-Wells’ uses facts and clear evidence to support his claims, which is an effective way to convince readers that what he is saying is valid and that climate change can no longer be ignored. In particular, his sections about climate plague and perpetual wars bring up many large issues that most people would not be aware of, and show that climate change has many widespread and disastrous effects beyond what are commonly publicized. 
           <br><br>


However, although he manages to persuade readers of the harsh reality of the situation, his article lacks a call to action. He does not provide any solutions for the situation or any means by which readers can get involved and make a change. He demonstrates how grim our future could be if we don’t start taking action, but he fails to inform us of what possible actions we can take. Because of this, although his article starts out strong and convincing, it lacks the balance required to leave the reader feeling motivated to make a change, leaving them with a feeling of helplessness and defeat instead.

David Wallace Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth" thoroughly explained our future with climate change if we continue down the path we are already on. He touches upon not just the general concept of the our Earth being and getting hotter, but also rising sea levels, the end of food, plagues, unbreathable air, war, economic collapse, poisoned oceans, and much more. I appreciated this article because it connected climate change to specific types of natural disasters and how these natural disasters impact Earth on a social and economic level. Unfortunately, many crises or other problems may seem so far away especially to people in the US holding a certain level of privilege (ex. WWIII, I do not want to speak for ALL people but a great amount of people (in the US) have the privilege of being able to ignore threats of WWIII since if war were to occur it would most likely not happen on American soil and instead on the soil of the poorer countries thereby affecting the people who live there). Reading this article really made me realize that no one is safe. Regardless of race, sex, class, etc, no one is safe from the effects of climate change. Wells does a great job of writing this article in hopes of spurring an emotion of being alarmed by this huge problem. I was extremely captivated while reading and I was in shock of how much I did not know and to the extent that climate change will affect the Earth and its people and animals. 
           <br><br>


Reading this did evoke a strong feeling of needing to do something and wanting to make change. Our generation must clean up the mess of what the past generation has handed down to us or else we are doomed. But at the same time, there are climate change skeptics and deniers and people who aren't phased by climate change or completely ignore the problem. It makes me also fearful to the point where I almost want to just accept that we're doomed and climate change will run its course and eventually bring us to the next extinction. It's hard because even if I, as an individual, make all the changes that would lower CO2 emissions, there are HUGE companies/powerful people who will continue to release CO2 into the air at an alarmingly dangerous rate. It feels hopeless hearing things that encourage individuals to carpool or take the bus to work for example to cut back on CO2 emissions, yet no one seems to be holding huge corporations accountable. 

           <br><br>

Overall, the article is very compelling and hits every point. I believe that what most people know about climate change is just scratching the surface and there is so much more underneath than just the Earth getting hot.

I found Davis Wallace-Wells’ article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” to be quite thought-provoking, even to readers who are already fairly informed about the climate crisis. Wallace-Wells goes into detail and explains specific consequences of climate change that aren’t typically the most discussed or known of, such as prehistoric plagues re-emerging from Arctic ice, and the relationship between climate change and violent conflict. I thought it was interesting to learn about these consequences of climate change that aren’t obvious, as someone who hasn’t explored the topic in much depth. The most shocking fact in the article to me was the statement that “every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice”. By putting that fact in simple and understandable terms, Wallace-Wells definitely got a strong point across.
           <br><br>

Wallace-Wells certainly took an alarmist approach and tone in the article. I believe this was rhetorically effective, and helped to emphasize the importance and severity of the climate crisis. In the article, he goes into “scientific reticence” and how many scientific articles seem to downplay the current situation, so it makes sense how he is trying to counter this. Although the alarmist approach may alienate some already skeptical readers, or may scare some readers out of taking optimistic action, the article is based in fact and science, so it really is just explaining the very possible harsh reality of our planet’s future.

While reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I was unsure whether to cry or make a drastic change to my lifestyle. Professor Ken touches on the title a climate change activist earns when the information they bring is too much to bear for some people. This term would be an "alarmist," but I don't believe Mr. Wallace should be considered such, as it often has a negative connotation due to some people seeing it as an exaggeration of information. Mr. Wallace is simply being realistic with scientific information to back it up. The world is heading down a direction that could in a decade be irreversible, and it's all due to the lack of climate action. Governments of the countries who hold most of the responsibility for our demise have turned their backs on the chance to act, all in efforts to achieve economic growth. Which in the future will be dragged to the ground as "There is a 12% chance that climate change will reduce global output by more than 50% by 2100" according to Mr. Wallace. 

           <br><br>

In the video, Professor Ken asks which of the topics in the reading scared us the most, well aside from being terrified by all 9, I would have to say the poisoned oceans. My answer is based on the fact that one of the mass extinctions the planet has already had, has been exactly this way. The ocean will gradually spread its dead zones killing everything in the ocean, which will simultaneously affect the atmosphere and begin to poison everything on land as well. If that doesn't leave you in a panic state, I don't know what does. Finally, I would like to repeat two phrases that have prompted a sense of urgency in me; the first one about the ocean, "Hydrogen sulfide is the planet's preferred gas for a natural holocaust" and the second as a warning, "Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future; going forward, we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past."

This article, unlike many other pieces regarding climate change, don't shy away from the devastating consequences of climate change. In addition to presenting state of the climate crisis, the article frequently depicts the unsightly future which is seemingly inevitable unless major changes are enacted on a global scale. I believe the article's presentation of the possibles dire futures that we are steadily realizing to be the most thought-provoking and eye-opening element. These glimpses of the future was shocking to me and filled me with a sense of urgency. Through this article, it's easy to see why climate change is an urgent matter that demands direct attention. 

           <br><br>

What really stood out to me in this article was the varies positive feed-back loops mentioned in the article. Dead zones  and anoxic bacteria is an example of this. The article also points to the loop between warming and the release of methane into the atmosphere. I think these feed back loops are terrifying as the situation will seemingly get perpetually and increasingly worse. This fact alone made me realize the urgency of the matter. I realized that climate change is not just static problem that needs to be solved, climate change is an ever evolving issue that humans must first acknowledge before doing everything possible to hinder this process. 

           <br><br>

What I didn't like about this article is that it's perhaps too alarmist. While the magnitude of this crisis certainly is great, I think this article is exaggerated at times. This article's claims about the future are based on what would happen if we continue down this path. In my opinion, this article undermines the present efforts to help with this issue. Rather than exploring practical way people are trying to hinder climate change, the article mentions a few far fetched concepts, ultimately ending with the idea that we will, at some point, find a way to stop climate change because we must.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells is written in such a manner of illustrating the results of inaction of individuals. The illustration created by Wallace-Wells is straightforward, and so much so could be labeled 'alarmist' by those doubting or in not fully convinced of a changing climate. The intent though is on a widespread scale toy with the idea of worldwide catastrophe. By specifically noting the fear and denial plaguing many on the topic, he is able to further emphasize his ideas behind widespread action and ramifications stemming from compliancy. He also goes onto target and really asses that the 'climate crisis' topic is not seemingly measurable to most, as most fear or events/catastrophe are a result of ideology and individuals, over something seemingly inconceivable, as that of the entire planet. The points he raises within the article begin to target common social practices of the people affected by climate change, as as such, I feels analysis of Wallace-Wells as alarmist is pushing a bit far, whereas a label as realist or something to do with an illustrated future based on current assumptions would be more plausible. While I feel that this is true, the listing and explanation of possible effects if there's inaction may draw away some readers, in fear of 'what can I do?'
           <br><br>


I feel that the information that Wallace-Wells portrays can be a lot for some people, but in my reading of it, I really began to feel a sense of how big these issues are, and how hard it can be to target. While it also made me feel driven to begin to seek out change not only as a individual with my habits, but to want to reach out to others as well as look into how I too could get involved with helping to change the policies that govern us.
           <br><br>
I was most compelled by the entry on the "end of food." This in part due to what I often associate, and what I've heard from others in reference to climate issues, in that "we'll just move elsewhere" in regards to crops. Although as painted by Wallace-Wells, this may not be such a perfect solution, as some of the places that may be currently too cold for crop production may become perfect, while those now suited for growing food may become infertile, and/or see a decline in productivity. 
           <br><br>
Author Wallace-Wells relies heavily upon statistics and assumptions of scientists interviewed in illustrating his 9 breakdowns of what could be. These help to back not only his credibility, but also reference and touch on associations individuals have with (often catastrophic) events happening now.

The article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells does a good job of communicating the seriousness of climate change. Many times, articles about climate change only focus on a few consequences such as sea level rise and the damage to cities. However, by focusing on the issues that affect everyone such as food security, heat waves, and the reemergence of ancient plagues. 
           <br><br>

This article is good at raising awareness to the issue of climate change and the seriousness of it, but it is very depressing. It does not offer a vision of hope for the future. However, there are still many things that we can do as individuals. A big one is to vote in local and national elections to elect officials who recognize the seriousness of climate change and will act.

After reading Wallace-Well's article on the state of the Earth going forward,  I am struck by how little exposure there is overall on the subject of climate change outside of classes and activist groups. I personally have seen little to no discussion in my daily life about the topic, and before entering college,  knew virtually nothing about the real dangers we face at the hands of climate change. Articles like this one target people like me that are privileged enough to ignore the problem because it will occur in a future that has not personally affected us yet. However, no matter how much some of us bury our heads in the sand and block it out, some, if not all of the consequences outlined by Wallace-Wells will reach us eventually, which is why he employs a call-to-action to the people that regard the problem with mere apathy. While he certainly employs fear tactics over instilling hope, there is merit in that it forces the current generation to act out of fear of this being the future that they will have to witness with their own eyes because they chose to do nothing. However, I do also think Wallace-Wells could have noted some ways that we can help the crisis at hand, with the most important being voting for environmentally conscious politicians, as many choose not to vote for any given reason.

After reading David Wallace-Wells’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I was shocked by the consequences he lists in climate change. The article did a superb job of expressing the dangers of climate change, especially to what will happen if the global temperatures rise about 4-6 degrees Celsius. He starts in the seed vault—Doomsday, which was designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe. The present tense of climate change-the destruction we’ve already baked into our future – is horrifying enough. We will lose many places this century even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade. Two degrees is our goal in the Paris climate, but it hard to achieve. The albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora. Each of these promises to accelerate warming. The second thing he talks about is heat. The rise in temperature will cause the death of people and plants. Climate change will also cause the end of food and we will have famine. Climates differ and plants vary, but the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming yields decline by 10 percent. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them. Nowadays, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature – which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity. It will also cause climate plagues, the diseases are now trapped in Arctic ice, they have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases, since before humans were around to encounter them. Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice. Climate change will also influence our air and cause war, permanent economic collapse, and poisoned oceans. 
           <br><br>


The author did a great job to explain the consequences rises by climate change by using statistics, other experts’ opinions, and examples. I was worried about our future and want to do something to help our planet. But the scientists know that to even meet the Paris goals, by 2050, carbon emissions from energy and industry, which are still rising, will have to fall by half each decade, emissions from land-use will have to zero out, and we will need to have invented technologies to extract twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do. The way to save our planet is simply unimaginable.

I totally agree with you. The article serves as a warning. If we still do not make any change, our planet will be destroyed by ourselves. So let's save energy and protect our planet together!!!

In “The Uninhabitable Earth,” David Wallace-Wells delivers an account of the climate crisis and the disastrous possibilities if humans fail to take action. In other words, David Wallace-Wells implements the view that if nothing is done, there will ultimately be an end to life on earth. The article first appeared in the year 2017 in the New York Magazine. What is most shocking to me about reading the article, is that much has happened in the world following that year due to the climate crisis. Even upon these recent months, places are flooding, animals are dying and people are left without homes, only to bring up a few of the things. There are recent fires in places like the Amazon rainforest, that according to the article provides the planet with 20% of our oxygen and Australia, that according to some sources has lost approximately 1 billion of its animals. Since the publication of the article and David Wallace-Wells’ book, much has happened to our world and continues without the issue being completely tackled down.
           <br><br>

Furthermore, I found it important that the article presents not only the causes and effects of the sea level rises and the melting of ice as once perceived to be called "global warming," but also talks about the impact the climate crisis has had in transforming other places from habitable to inhabitable. As a result of all this information about the state of our planet, I feel more inclined than before to learn about this crisis and what can be done to save the planet. In just by reading this article, I was more convinced that the issue is more than just the sea level rising, but about the loss of many habitats and life.

When reading David Wallace-Wells’, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I found his “alarmist” perspective paired with the information in the article well and was needed in order to get all of his points across.  While I did leave the article feeling saddened by the data that was presented, I was more motivated to go out and make real changes before it is too late.  I think that we as a society are past the point of being able to  sugar coat what could very well be all of our futures.  The time to hope that climate change won’t happen or wait for someone else to do something about it without making any lifestyle changes for yourself has come and gone.  We are in a critical point in the anthropogenic era of the world where we can either take immediate action now or face dire, irreversible consequences.  The world should be alarmed.  We can see time and time again in the last few decades that tip toeing around the issue has not sparked enough desire for change from the public, so it is time to buckle down and get serious about the issues at hand.  The article is unsettling and terrifying because what is happening in the atmosphere and what has already begun to happen to our earth is unsettling and terrifying.  Everyone needs to stop worrying about how perfectly precise the predictions for the future are and criticizing David Wallace-Wells tone and start talking about the actual issues at hand that will begin, at least to some extent, to come true and by then it may be too late to do anything about it. 
           <br><br>


One quote that really resonated with me was “no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough” (Wallace-Wells, 2017).  To me, it meant that no matter how much you know, study, or talk about the problems at hand, nothing will be solved until you take ACTION.  Learning and education is a very important step to leading a more sustainable life, but putting that information to use is how to make real change in this world.  The predictions for the future may be exaggerated and showing worse case scenarios, but that will wake up even the earth conscious people to keep them eager to learn new statistics and new ways to help the earth so that our generation does not make the same mistakes that the past generations did.  We need to be alarmed, informed, and ready to take action to try and mitigate the damages that will change the earth for the worst in ways we have yet to really imagine or truly grasp.

Even from the first few sentences of this article, it is quite clear what David Wallace Wells is trying to do. He is trying to scare his readers out of complacency and into action. Fear tactics have been used by many (educators, politicians, global leaders), and they can be an effective way to achieve a goal. But at the same time, fear can be paralyzing. After reading the article, I felt a little helpless. If we are headed towards this level of catastrophe, how can I do anything to stop it? Many people feel this way when it comes to climate change. They feel their actions as one individual are insignificant, and therefore pointless. Once I got over the initial anxiety from reading this article, it did however inspire me to reevaluate certain lifestyle changes I can make to help the crisis, because it can’t hurt, right? 

           <br><br>

Each section of the article discussed different doomsday scenarios that our planet is heading towards if we do not make drastic changes immediately. The one I found most interesting (and anxiety inducing) was the “Climate Plague” section. The idea of prehistoric diseases reemerging from melting arctic ice is terrifying, and not widely discussed. As Wallace Wells mentions, you hear about ocean levels rising and increasing heat waves in the media, but not often do you come across a story discussing the dangers of ancient viruses trapped in the ice. This article does a good job of breaking down the different issues our planet will be facing if we keep on the same track.

I agree that Wallace Wells is attempting to frighten his readers into action by using fear tactics. Additionally, I think this strategy made me feel helpless and insignificant in trying to help fight climate change. In order to make readers like myself feel like they can contribute to fighting the climate crisis, I think Wallace Wells could have supplemented the points he had about the possible and likely effects of the climate crisis with specific ways to prevent such disastrous results. However, I found that the immense amount of information that Wallace Wells includes in the article inspired me to live more environmentally friendly. Clearly, it is hard for a massive amount of people to collectively begin a new lifestyle in the blink of an eye, but one person taking the first steps to combat climate change is a step in the right direction, no matter how small.


The Climate Plague portion of the article was the section I too found most interesting and surprising. Because of the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels and the increase of the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes, the possible reintroduction of deadly diseases has taken a backseat. This section brought to my attention a phenomenon that I only thought was fictional, something only possible in a movie, but it's scary to think that it could be a reality if we continue to treat the Earth the way we are treating it. The introduction of ancient viruses could be something more deadly than the insane wildfires and hurricanes we know all too well and that uncertainty is scary.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” tells the shocking effects that the rising CO2 emissions will have on the earth. The effects are catastrophic without immediate action according to Wallace-Wells. The alarmist approach to these events are said to shock the reader into action, although personally shocking is an understatement. Articles like these make it seem like there is a bleak future ahead of us. Although I can appreciate the awakening to how dire the situation is, and I'll admit that after reading I wanted to turn off every electrical appliance in the house including my grandmother's life support, I do not believe this is the correct approach to stirring people into action. What's the point of trying if things are so bad as the article makes them seem already? I do not disagree that the effects need an immediate response nor that the effects can be catastrophic but fear mongering is not what will inspire people to change.

"The Uninhabitable Earth” is definitely an alarming piece for people who are relatively unfamiliar with the real impact of Climate crisis. However, even as a person who had been educated with some knowledge of Climate crisis in classroom settings, this piece is still quite a shocker for me. I believe David Wallace-Wells have good intentions writing this article trying to uncover the whole truth of Climate crisis to the public, since it had never been a more urgent issue of the new decade. With such a dire situation like this, it is imperative that the mass public must be thoroughly educated with this harsh reality that every one on this planet is facing, as it would soon affect all of us. On a personal remark, I definitely feel a sense of unease after reading the article, and I am more compelled to do something with the Climate crisis. In the meantime, I do feel a little helpless about this situation because there was so little an individual can do to avert this crisis. I believe the real audiences should be those who hold power and can make policies to help protect our Earth.
           <br><br>

Out of all the factors in the article, I found the Perpetual War most compelling because it corresponds to what I had learned in Psychology last quarter. In one of the chapters, we talked about how competing resources can lead to major scale aggression, and with resources being more and more limiting in some regions of the world, this concept comes into play perfectly. And with these aggression leads to brutal conflicts and massive casualties, who would know that we, the people on the other side of the planet, would be part of the reason to blame for that?

Before reading David Wallace-Wells’s article “The Unhabitable Earth,” I had never read an article regarding climate change and its effects. It is hard to not at least know about climate change, whether you believe in its significance or not, and everyone has at least heard about global warming or climate change because of how prevalent it is in today’s daily conversations. However, it is one thing to simply just know about climate change and what it generally means for us, and it is another to fully understand what we do and how it really impacts our lives and planet. 

           <br><br>

Wells summarizes how important it is to change our daily habits and lives by going into brutally honest detail about what our future looks like if we do not make changes. The truth about our future is scary and it is important to not ease the blow by making it seem much less serious than it is. Wells’s article is not too alarmist; if people do not really understand the impact of what they’re doing, it will not hit them as something that is very urgent. In general I feel as if people will not really have the motivation to make a change until they realize that it will be affecting their lives directly, and when people see that their lives are in imminent danger, they will be more willing to do something and make a change.
            <br><br>

Reading this article really made an impact on how I view how climate change will change the world. I vaguely knew that polar ice caps were melting and that sea levels were rising, but I did not fully understand what that meant for us. I never would have imagined that climate change could even change things like human behavior. It was eye opening to understand the full impact of what could be happening to us in just a short time away if we do not make some changes.

After reading The Uninhabitable Earth, I was astonished that by the climate change caused by human beings. This article introduces what the earth is going through in terms of climate, environment, food, economy, politics and so on. Global warming, rising sea levels, food shortages, climate disease, inadequate oxygen, endless wars, collapsing economies, and polluted ocean are all signs of the end of the world. The author David Wallace-Wells presents the reality of the environmental problems to readers by studying some of the worst cases: the earth's climate is indeed changing. Humans are responsible for this change. This article allows people to get more in touch with and see the issue clearly in an objective way. We also have to deal with climate change. However, my thoughts are somewhat pessimistic. The earth has been through more than four billion years, and the last ice age was less than ten thousand years ago. If the human race is going to die, it will be no more than a pointless struggle to protect the environment, but it is always a good thing to protect the environment moderately.

"Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future; going forward, we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past." This is one of the many sentences that stuck in my head after the conclusion of the article. During my time here at UCSB I've experienced several events that are rightly considered natural disasters. In the midst of the Thomas Fire I would check the weather app on my phone to know whether or not I should attend my classes or I should just stay home. The school handed out masks to filter the air, and the sun shined through the smoke clouds with a dark red glow reflecting the blazing fire. After finals were cancelled and I made the 100 mile drive back to the San Fernando Valley where I'm from, I could see the fire every moment of the drive. Then this past fall quarter it very nearly happened again. It felt far too familiar. While David Wallace Wells does paint a very dystopian future should we continue to pump CO2 into the atmosphere, I do not believe he is alarmist. He is trying to trigger people into action and clearly merely experiencing only the beginning of climate change isn't enough I believe he's doing the write thing. While reading this I did ask myself "Why should I care? Should I continue to be a vegetarian? Is it worth it?" but when he concludes his article with a note of optimism that human kind will solve the problem "because we must", I felt re-invigorated with my passion to continue to do what must be done. The article makes one lose all hope briefly before getting injected with just enough hope at the end to make anyone want to act, at least more than the were before reading it.

I found the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” to be very interesting and eye opening. It kind of goes right into the details and, while it is alarming, I believe it needed to be said. Everyone needs to be alarmed and obviously dropping little bits of information to people is not working. They need to be told the whole problem up front. People need to be scared of what’s to come for change to happen. It needs to be the biggest concern. However, even though this article does make people want to take action, it also might make people feel useless because there is so much that needs to be changed in order for there to be any difference. There was so much I learned from this article. I honestly had no clue that carbon dioxide was being trapped underground. What was really alarming is to find out there is also several types of diseases buried as well. The more we keep letting carbon dioxide out, the more risks we take. This article was really thought provoking and I believe everyone should read it over to finally understand the full truth about what we are doing to our earth. People see this article as controversial because they see him as an alarmist just trying to scare people into action, well actually he is just being brutally honest and we have to stop sugar coating our explanation on what climate change is really doing, how fast it’s occurring, and what we are all really risking. People needed to know the truth. Our earth really is becoming uninhabitable.

Wells’ analysis about the negative consequence of the 2-degree increase in the global temperature really scared me. There are so many potential crisis if we did not do anything to stop or diminish the global warming. After reading his article, I think that there is no point to sit down and cry, since we still have change to change the current situation. Even probably we cannot make it back into the picture of Eden, just like the film Before the Flood presents in the beginning, we can still do something to make it better. Otherwise, I will definitely regret later. Before I read this article, I thought I know enough about the climate change, because all the news, media, and also the courses since I enrolled in primary school has been talking about it all day. However, we are not able to change our life styles, since people are not willing to make life more difficult just in order to protect the environment, to slow down the climate change, which seems far away from our daily life. However, the more I get into the climate change, the more I think we could actually do something, instead of listening others talking about how important it is to slow down the climate change.

After reading the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth”, by David Wallace-Wells’, I was thoroughly shocked. Having already taken a few classes on climate change, I had a sense of how serious our climate crisis truly is, but reading his article left me even more concerned. Wallace-Wells takes an alarmist approach on climate change, discussing evidence that has given scientists high confidence any warming greater than 1.5 degrees celsius will have extremely detrimental effects on human and natural systems. His alarmist viewpoint is an extremely necessary one to have, as we have already taken up two thirds of the given budget. The concern in Wallace-Wells’ writing is key as some still hold the mindset that their generation will not have to address these problems, a lack of education on climate change plays a large role in this unaware and uncaring dynamic. Unfortunately, these problems are anything but in the future. While 1.5 degree celsius is a concerning increase, a slight raise even higher to 2 degrees could prove catastrophic. The fate of the climate crisis rests in mankind's hands depending on what happens within the next couple of decades. Our actions and inactions between now and then are crucial for what the future will look like.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” starts off with a sentence that without a doubt grabs the reader’s attention. The bold claim that “it” in fact is worse than anyone thinks has the reader scared before they even know what “it” is. The article goes on to say not too much further on that however alarmed you are, you are not nearly alarmed enough. These themes, as seen throughout the writing, create a strong fear-mongering narrative. I understand that this is a useful tactic for some moments and for some people, as it is thought that if someone is scared enough about something it will lead them to action. While I do think we need to spread awareness, I don’t think we need to spread specifically “alarmedness.” Once a person is aware of the current reality, they will be alarmed enough without being motivated by fear alone, but by knowledge. 
            <br><br>
I liked how the article validated oceans and temperature rising as important issues but went beyond these facts and delved into direct results. One example of this for me was the section that talked about droughts. I obviously knew that droughts were a big issue but I had never really thought about their terrifying eventual outcomes. The thought about how we will feed the nation when soil is so longer viable to harvest seems outlandish but is actually closer than we think.
            <br><br>
One last. aspect of this article that really struck me was the section on the mass extinctions. This was also mentioned in class and I think that it is something that needs to be talked about more. The statistic of the 97% of the population being wiped in the most recent mass extinction is so jarring that it is close to unfathomable how it seems that our odds will eventually be heading in a similar outcome. This also ties back into my last point about starvation as it will be a cog in the machine of extinction.

As a senior in the Environmental Studies program here at UCSB I have seen my fair share of literature and media describing the projected realities of climate change. Wallace-Wells, however, takes it a step further and goes into great detail of some of the worst issues caused by a rising climate in an attempt to get people to realize that the massive issue is happening now and requires immediate attention from quite literally everyone on Earth. A lot of other students have said this but the article really invokes an immense feeling of hopelessness. While I most definitely do not think ignorance is the better answer here, I personally found it to be a little debilitating. There is a fine line between trying to get people to wake up and realize the seriousness of the issue while also making sure that there is some hope to prevent people from giving up altogether - which is especially important because the very people that we need to get to act now will likely not be here to see the worst effects that Wallace-Wells describes. 
             <br><br>

I should note the paragraph towards the ends that talks about optimism in the climate scientist community. Wallace-Wells describes the faith as "We will find a way to forestall radical warming, they say, because we must". I think this methodology of optimism is helpful for me because of my commitment to contribute to the solution-making process of protecting the environment but I fear that it could possibly lead to the lack of accountability that we need if we are going to save the earth from rising temperatures. It could be really easy for people to read that and take that as everything will be ok because other people are thinking about it. I did like, however, the mention of successful projects like the Apollo project. Reminders of success are important in the doom-and-gloom that comes with talking about the climate crisis.

David Wallace- Wells writes in his article, “Even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to comprehend its scope.” This is definitely very true, as a student, we are always told that climate change is real and it is bad, but we are never really educated on how bad it actually is. It is alarming that Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s atmosphere, and when it thaws, the methane released is 34 times as powerful than carbon dioxide. Scientists have yet found a way to deal with the permafrost melt.  We live in a society that doesn’t even see warming as a problem worth addressing. We turn a blind eye to this epidemic because we believe that the problem is bigger than us and that we can’t do anything about it. It is discouraging that the damage we have already done is irreversible, as David Wallace- Wells writes in his article “No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.”  
              <br><br>
Learning that cities around the world have already  experienced deadly heat waves scares me. Knowing that we just might be cooked to death is extremely scary. If the heat doesn’t kill us first, it might just be the lack of food. We will experience “50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them.” Living in southern california, I have grown up being told that the state is in a current drought and that water conservation should be a priority. So I have experienced first hand the effects of global warming. Drought will ultimately leave most of our food sources unreliable. The possibility of ancient diseases trapped in ice being released when thawed is terrifying. Zika has made an appearance only recently because it was originally trapped in Uganda and with every degree increase in temperature, the parasite reproduces ten times faster. Zika will become more deadly as the overall global temperature increases. It is insane that every round- trip ticket on flights from New York to London costs the Arctic three more square meters of i

The "Uninhabitable Earth" is an eye-opening article and a necessary read for many people, especially millennials and those of Generation Z who will play a huge role in the future of our possibly uninhabitable world. Prior to reading "The Uninhabitable Earth", I was really only aware of the rising sea levels and the fact that our planet was warming at an extreme pace. David Wallace-Wells gives nine different consequences of the climate crisis, backed up by very specific and alarming evidence. What interested me was the potential conflict and unbreathable air that will arise from the warming of our earth and the increasing amounts of carbon dioxide that we are breathing. Wallace-Wells points out that "...current trends suggest it (carbon-dioxide) will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100. At that concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent." Humans need to realize that their hazardous actions do not only negatively impact our wildlife and ecosystems, it impacts our own brains and the way that our DNA is wired. 
              <br><br>

People call David Wallace-Wells an “alarmist” for portraying the future of our world in such a grim way. I can see why some would feel this way. Humans cannot grasp an idea that is so unknown and different from the life they live now. I think it is incredibly hard to picture not being able to go outside in the summer without the possibility of dying, or having tornadoes be common. I think it is even harder to picture this version of life being somewhere near in the future. As for me, I strongly agree with Wallace-Wells argument. Global warming is a concept that has quickly started to change the world around us. And our world is much larger than each individual human that inhabits it. The more humans continue to contribute to global warming, the faster we will be wiped out by increasing global disasters. I believe that if humans are aware of these consequences and the potential future of our world, then we will feel motivated to make a real, impactful effort to change our current ways and protect our planet and humanity before it is too late.

Author David Wallace-Wells demonstrates his point of view in his article "The Uninhabitable Earth" that our earth is currently facing detrimental challenges created by human behaviors. Due to the industrial developments by humans, our earth has already warmed by one degree celsius. One celsius sounded like a small change, but it was significant! Wallace-Wells emphasized the facts that global warming is not only sea-level rising, but many other crucial tragedies. One of the consequences is that as the temperature keeps going up, the Arctic permafrost can be defrost and release "1.8 trillion tons of carbon". These gases are 34 times more powerful than greenhouse-gas. The alteration of the carbon concentration can threaten all the living species on the planet.
              <br><br>

The author also introduces a few aspects that I heard for the first time.  For example in the section of Climate Plague. I learned that as ice melts, many diseases could be brought back to our lives. More importantly, it is happening right now. According to the reading, several cases of ancient disease infections were deadly. Even though our medical field is boosting, disease control is still a big problem. Also, the probability of war is also related to temperature. Global warming is not only a scientific problem, but also a social challenge. Maintaining the two degree celsius is much more than the collapse of cities, but challenges from society, economy, and science.

There is something definitely impactful about Wallace-Well’s “The Uninhabitable Earth.”  Whether it’s the fear induced realization from the section titled “Doomsday” or the horrify descriptions of droughts that cause the lands to become deserts, the article does get the message across of the severity of climate change. This is something also that I feel is this article’s down fall. Some people might be skeptical to read this article and possibly might discredit its discourse. It doesn’t necessarily ease one into its conversation as much as it slaps you in face with it. Fortunately, I think this is where Wallace’s article reinforces the climate issues when it supports these crazy scenarios like “heat death,” with the statistical support by scientist and articles written since the 1980 that predicted these scenarios. 
              <br><br>
I can’t argue that this article doesn't have a sense of “catastrophes of biblical proportions” (even if they are 100% plausible). 
              <br><br>


There are various introductions to philosophical and grand ideas like the “Fermi paradox” or the “Great Filter” that really help expand these ideas of climate change, into some that affects us (mankind) all. It makes us think of the bigger picture. We begin to ask if our actions are affecting the people around us, or what if the point of life at this very moment in time is decided on the action we take like some crazy RPG. I believe this is the hidden point that Wallace is trying to make—that we are both the problem and the cure.

After reading and internalizing the information in David Wallace-Wells’ article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I found his alarmist approach to provoke a scared yet motivated emotion. I have come to realize little steps will not work to stop the planet from becoming our enemy in war, as he puts it. Instead, the global population needs immediate action so future generations can survive in the environment without dying of heat stroke.
               <br><br>

The most alarming fact to me about the Climate Crisis is how some of the other mass extinctions have almost wiped out of all of life on Earth. As Wallace-Wells puts it, the most notorious happened 252 million years ago when 97% of life on Earth died. Knowing we are currently adding more carbon to the atmosphere now than before is completely frightening. We need intergenerational justice and take care of the planet so future generations can thrive.

<p>
While I don’t think David Wallace Wells is an alarmist, I don’t necessarily agree with his approach on calling his audience to action. 
               <br><br>
A alarmist’s definition is “someone who is considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic,” and while David is causing worry and panic, the arguments he gives to evoke these emotions are in no way exaggerated or unwarranted. Wallace is very captivating throughout the the article. While reading it, my eyes were glued to the page as I read more and more future disasters with a morbid curiosity. He backups each argument with current statistics that the situations are already underway. 
               <br><br>
The one scenario that particularly stood out to me was the loss of food production. His comparison to the dust bowl was quite frightening as any high-school educated American will easily understand its horrors from previous classes. To make it worse, he claimed that the droughts would be more severe than any droughts in the last thousand years, including one that “dried up all the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains” and may have been responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization. The mental image of barren rivers and refrigerators is terrifying because I know there’d be no way to sustain the world’s new huge population. 
               <br><br>

In Wallace’s IX section, The Great Filter, I agreed with his argument on the reasons of human stagnation and inability to realize the true gravity of the situation. The situation can be explained by the psychological phenomenon of flashbulb memory. Flashbulb memory is where sudden, traumatic events will essentially produce a detailed, highly vivid “snapshot” memory of the event. That is why, like Wallace says, people will remember where they were so vividly when they found out about 9/11, but will not care as much about slower, gradual events such as climate change.  When you hear about climate change, it is gradual. With every little bit of information on icebergs collapsing into the sea or coral reefs dying, you get a sense of horror. However, this sense of horror comes in small doses and does not have the same flashbulb effect as more dramatic events. Regardless of whether you logically understand the gravity of the situation, the crisis will often be pushed to the back of your mind as more instantaneously flashy things dominate your attention. 
               <br><br>

Like I mentioned before, I definitely do not agree with Wallace’s technique. While I do understand and agree with his approach of using scare tactics, he is not delivering his message correctly. While reading the article, the audience is struck with fright, which he should manipulate in order to spurr them into motion. However, the overall message that I garnered from reading the article is that the everything is doomed. He writes that “But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed...have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion, too: No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.” Human beings thrive on hope. After leaving his audience in complete despair, how does he possibly expect people to act when ,according to him, they are doomed regardless? This article is good for helping people wake up, but there must be more optimism in order for our attempts to be successful.

Before joining this class, I wasn't really too aware of what was going on in the world. I knew climate change was a thing, but I never imagined it to this extent. After reading David Wallace-Wells' "The Uninhabitable Earth" I could not fathom how big of a hole we have dug ourselves into. Henceforth, I do not agree with the notion that he is an "alarmist". Now more than ever do we need people to realize the amount of damage we are doing to our own environment. There is no easy way to approach this besides informing people of the detriments that are to come in the near future if no action is taken. Being that I am fairly new to the whole climate crisis thing, I haven't read many articles discussing the issues portrayed Wallace's article Nevertheless, I found this reading to be very informative and well written with a few key points that stood out to me. One of the topics I found most interesting in his article was "The End Of Food".  This portion of the article mentions that by the end of the century, the global population will rise by 50 percent while the resources we will have to feed the world will decrease by 50 percent. This topic really makes me feel bad for the 50 percent that will suffer from the lack of resources because a great majority of them will come from poor and underdeveloped countries. As Ken mentioned in lecture, we (the U.S) are one of the biggest reasons behind the global crisis, but its the countries that have made little to no contribution towards the crisis who will suffer the most. Another topic I found quite interesting was "Heat Death". I am a horrible person when it comes to those hot summer days and I can't fathom an inevitable rise in temperature that would literally cook people in regions such as Costa Rica.  All in all this article was a great awakening for myself and I can only hope that the rest of the world soon realizes that we must act now before its too late.

It is as if Wallace was describing the events of an apocalyptic movie. I think that that was his intended goal by opening up with the title "Doomsday." Once I was done reading this article, I left my laptop open to the article and reclined back into my chair, staring deep into the wall thinking "this article doesn't matter." With all the data and statistics that we have on climate change, I would imagine there being a tremendous shift towards reversing all of our pollution. Most of us in this class are too young to remember this, and some of us weren't even born yet, but at the turn of the century in 1999, there was a widespread panic about the Y2K bug. It was said that the Y2K bug would cause the economy to crash and that there would be a lot of malfunction with computers because all of our technology at the time where programmed with a calendar that stopped in the year 2000. There were billions of dollars invested into fixing this issue right before the end of 1999, and thankfully a crisis was avoided (look it up, it really did happen). But even at the risk of going extinct, nothing drastic is being done about climate change. 
<br><br>
Wallace concludes the article with a sort of hopeful tone towards the future, acknowledging that we have been in tight pickles before and have somehow engineered our way out. True. But this is an issue that can't be handled the way we college students typically do on assignments. We can not procrastinate on climate change.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” is an article written by David Wallace-Wells which describes the severity of climate change. In my opinion, the author provided some different angles and point of views of it. Usually, the articles discussing climate change would say that using less fossil fuels is an effective way to decelerate the global warming, and bring out a conclusion about the raising of sea level. But in this article, David Wallace said that the issue of climate change is too difficult to solve, and it is much more serious than we thought. The article also had some strong evidence, for example: As the global temperature goes up, the Arctic permafrost will ultimately melt, which 1.8 trillion tons of carbon contained may evaporate as methane, a strong greenhouse gas which will be harmful to the climate.

David Wallace-Well's "The Uninhabitable Earth" brings up the Fermi paradox, which suggests that the life span of an industrial civilization could be very short, just a few hundred years and that climate change brought about by fossil fuel use could be a cause of this, the so called "Big Filter". This would be one of the reasons we don't see life anywhere else in the universe. I thought this was an interesting idea, but I don't think climate change is the only candidate for the big filter (nuclear war, bio-weapons).

The article " The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells is a very interesting read. His article really goes into depth of the possible and very realistic outcomes of climate change. The article itself starts with the word " Doomsday" which caught my attention early on. That says it all, climate change is happening and will continue to happen if nothing is done in order to stop it. David Wallace-Wells describes the possible senarios that could happen if climate change continues at the rate that is going. "Heat Death", "The End of Food", "Climate Plagues", "Unbreathable Air", "Perpetual War" ,"Permanent Economic Collapse", " Poised Oceans" and the "Great Filter" are all possible outcomes of the future. 
               <br><br>
 Wells is seen as an alarmist and I see why people would label him as that. But at the rate that climate change is happening and the efforts as of now to stop climate change from progressing the way it his "alarmist" view point is very much needed. Many people do not see the urgency of the situation at hand. Not only is it already affecting people right now but it will affect the generations after. Wells talks about heat under the Heat Death section. He talks about the temperature going up and how  much more lethal it would be if the world continues to get hotter.

<p>
As someone who is a very staunch believer in climate change and the belief that we must take immediate action, I feel that David Wallace-Wells "The Uninhabitable Earth" acts much like a double edged sword in the fight to save our planet. More specifically, the main issue I have with the article in the pure sensationalism or alarmism (as Professor Hiltner mentioned) that guides the content and message of the article. On one hand, to the uneducated who know nothing about climate change whatsoever, it is effective in scaring them about the issue and to take action since what they read they will take at face value as 100% true. This is ultimately a necessary good if we want to advance forward the reversal of climate change agenda. On the other hand though, to those who have a knowledgable to somewhat knowledgable grasp of climate change and other various current and past events in the world may read the article and point out its alarmism, thus diminishing the importance of the climate change reversal agenda. In my personal reading, many claims where exaggerated for the purpose of theatre/drama and the tonality and vernacular of the author further lended to that point. This sensational alarmist article can then be used as propaganda by climate change deniers to further their cause of disinformation by saying how the other side is "insane" or "making stuff up". I feel that had the author taken a more objective and factual approach towards writing this article, than its message would be vastly more effective. Although it is clear that the intended purpose of this article was to garner support and inform people on the absolute necessity for climate change action, it may have done more harm against this cause than good.

I believe “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells is an extremely useful tool in conveying information about climate change to average citizens. Although the article paints a bleak picture through the usage of descriptive language and statistics, Wallace-Wells is able to convey the true gravity of the situation we’re dealing with, which many fail to understand. One way this is accomplished is through highlighting potential consequences like the health consequences of toxic air, increases in armed conflict over resources, and decline in availability of cereal crops. These issues stick out to the reader because they are unlike the threats of global warming, sea level rise, and biodiversity loss that they have heard over and over and are perceived to not affect them directly. In this sense, the issues Wallace-Wells presents catch the reader’s attention and show how they could experience climate change. 
                <br><br>
Additionally, I do not believe that Wallace Wells’ tone is too alarmist. Although he is painting a bleak picture, Wallace-Wells is only telling the reality we will be experiencing if we do not shift as a society to combat climate change. I believe that people deserve to know the truth, rather than be cushioned in believing that somehow this issue won’t cause colossal damage, and will only act if they feel alarmed. On the topic of alienating some readers, I am reminded of a comment Wallace- Wells made in a video for Hot Mess titled “Climate Change: Are You Scared Enough”. He remarked that the number of people that aren’t worried enough about climate change is far greater than the number of people that are at risk of being so alarmed that they will be thrown into disassociation. I deeply agree with this point. Although this article alarmed me, I felt motivated and driven to action. I believe that alarmist language is our most effective way in engaging the masses, as long as we provide avenues that people can use to get involved in the issue.

It should not be the responsibility of scientists to sensor their research to protect our feelings from the consequences of our own actions. Suggesting that the accurate portrayal of our future reality Wallace-Wells' provides in "The Uninhabitable Earth" if do not take action against climate change is "too alarmist" is, at its root, the fundamental problem we are facing when trying to educate the general public on these topics. Everyone on our planet should be terrified for the future (or impending lack thereof), because complacency is quite obviously getting us nowhere. 
                <br><br>
That being said, if this article was the knowledge an average reader had on the topic, the information can quickly become daunting and overwhelming. It's productive if, at some point, articles of this nature outline things that individuals can do to help curb the climate crisis. It is not altogether too late to create change for the better, even on a small-scale, personal level. This article also does not intend to show climate change deniers the errors of their beliefs, but persuade apathetic, middle-grounders that this is a topic worth worrying about. So in that sense it does alienate climate change deniers, but hopefully skeptics would be more inclined to pay attention. 
                <br><br>
The consequence outlined in Wallace-Wells' "The Uninhabitable Earth" which most concerns me personally is food shortage. So many people on this planet are suffering starvation now, it's hard to imagine a world crippled by droughts, fighting global famine. Food is one of the few foundational pillars in the necessities of life, it's very scary to imagine a world where food is not guaranteed to anyone.

I completely agree with everything in this response. People have to know the current situation that we are in and might even have to be scared into finally changing their behavior. Sugar-coating everything scientists put out isn't going to motivate people to do anything because they will keep thinking everything is okay and there's nothing to fear. We currently have quite a lot to be scared about and people need to work together in every way they can otherwise things like famine and natural disasters will be a more prominent reality. 
                <br><br>
I agree that it is not too late to change for the better also, people should know every little thing they can do to help prevent this worldwide crisis because it is all of our duties. Younger generations know they haven't caused this issue but are more than willing to start changing lifestyles, and older people need to jump aboard for at least their children or grandchildren's sake. Climate change deniers need to know the errors in their beliefs I think, and I also hope they would pay attention because when they figure out they're wrong, they'll need to know what to do to help fight against the crisis. To conclude, we rightfully are scared and I don't think sugar-coating it will help anyone. We only have so much time.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” had completely changed my understanding of our environment and the severity of the influence of climate change. This article successfully serves as an alarm to the public and enables us to know how climate change is quickly transforming our planet. Although some scientists disagree that global warming has been generated by fossil fuel, actually they are aimed to raise doubts in our mind about its nature and severity so as to slow people’s actions and allow the fossil fuel industry to continue business as long as possible. 
                <br><br>

Wallace-Wells also takes advantage of a series of statistical evidence and conclusions of credible scientific research to further illustrate the severity and urgency of this issue, addressing the dangerous situation that nowadays humans and the planet are facing. His employment of these facts sufficiently and effectively urges the audience to place more attention to climate change and take action to handle the issue.

David Wallace Wells'  "The Uninhabitable Earth" paints a picture of how catastrophic the climate crisis could be. Before this article, I knew the basic information about the climate crisis, which already left me alarmed for the future. However, after reading this article, the climate crisis frightens me. Wells brings up what seems like every possible horrible outcome of the climate crisis while offering no solutions to the issue. Surprisingly, I think that this is a great way to convey the issue. Wells avoids the issue that climate scientists have repeatedly made -- failing "to communicate how dire the threat really was." Despite the fact that this article was emotionally draining, I have to admit that I have learned more from Wells than I have from any other article or film. For example, I never knew that the permafrost at the poles holds such a significant amount of carbon. For how shocking this information is, I can't believe that it has never been conveyed to me in the past. I also learned that the IPCC doesn't account for the albedo effect in its reports. Just these two examples show how the climate crisis hasn't been displayed in the dire way it should be.

This article is probably the scariest thing I have read in a long time, if not ever. I am shocked that the information in this article is not common knowledge. Each section of the article brought another twist that the burning of fossil fuels is causing. In “Heath Death”, I learned that in some parts of the world, seven degrees Celsius of warming will cause the human body would be cooked to death in a matter of hours. In “Climate Plagues”, I learned that global warming will scramble our once-stable ecosystems, as the tropics move North and take misquotes with them. In “Perpetual War”, I was terrified to learn about the direct relationship between climate and conflict. Studies show that for every half-degree of warming, societies will see somewhere between a 10 and 20% increase in the chances of armed conflict. In “Poisoned Oceans”, I learned that by the end of the century, sea levels are projected to rise by at least four feet, which is petrifying considering that a whole ⅓ of the world’s cities are located on the coast. The bottom line is that the information in this article is essential knowledge but at the same time extremely scary. It was refreshing to read at the end that climate scientists still have faith that we will turn this crisis around, their reasoning being that we will find a way because we have to.

When reading Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth”, it is apparent that the author’s intention is to strike fear in his audience. Even in his first couple of sections outlining a few dire changes to our world, these outcomes were so extreme that human life would barley, or not even, be possible. For me, I would agree with critics that Wallace-Wells is an alarmist, as his future scenarios are very severe. However, I believe it is for the common good of waking the world up to its potential near-future disaster. Though some of his scenarios may seem far-fetched, he does include additional scientific proof that suggests and outlines these possible outcomes. These potential outcomes can serve as a template of what can be to come, which in turn can cause one to panic, in a good way, as to prevent these terrible outcomes requires action. 
                <br><br>

I thought the most interesting topic that Wallace-Wells introduced was the ‘Great Filter’ part at the end of the article. It was really intriguing for him to bring up the Fermi Paradox, which is something that has had scientists questioning for centuries. If this so called ‘Great Filter’ did exist, and no form of sentient life has had the ability to overcome it, is this the end of humanity? This particularly section of Wallace-Wells’ article confused me, as I didn’t see his goal for adding this. I felt that this part would confuse or even depress the reader, as it entails that there isn’t any hope in sight, and humanity is destined to become extinct. Because of this, I feel that part of this article wasn’t designed to warn or alert the reader, but to tell us that if the end is inevitable, and we should be ready to accept it.

Though critics of "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells may call him an alarmist, I do not feel that his research reflects alarmist as his article is grounded on data, as the professor mentioned that the article was created with the help of dozens of interviews and exchanged with climatologists and researchers. The possible consequences that Wallace Wells states in his articles are not exaggerated in my opinion as they do reflect the pattern of past consequences of the climate crisis. They possible consequences take in consideration existing material conditions and does not create anything new, but rather works with what is already existing, such as plaque hidden in the arctic ice, Anthropocene, and the amount of carbon dioxide that has increased. This article therefore ties together what is already existing and global warming consequences that has already occurred, bringing them together to clearly depict what may happen if such climate change trends continue. 
                <br><br>

Though I have read most of the consequences of climate change in other sources, I am always met with shock because I am reminded on how such a large scale the climate crisis will effect people; this is on a global scale which will consequentially effect everyone to a certain degree. The climate crisis will affect humanity in every facet possible, and as even indicated in the article, through social relations. One consequence that I feel the need to elaborate on however is the permanent economic collapse. As the world  is powered by global capitalism, the primary functioning of capitalism is to work towards profit maximization, thus a cycle of 'boom and bust' is a characteristic of it. Global financial collapse is inevitable through the process of capitalism, as evident throughout history and periodic recessions/ depressions. Therefore, global financial collapse under capitalist globalization is still inevitable regardless of fossil capitalism or not. This specific point that I went in depth on also is my biggest concern of the article, which is failing to identify the creators of the climate crisis.
                <br><br>

The article failed to  deeper mention how exactly and who exactly is causing this climate crisis, as the climate crisis has not existed as long as humanity has. The largest perpetuators of the climate crisis would be the ruling elite, as 70% of Carbon emissions is created by 30 global corporations. Thus, it would be reductive to equally place the blame and thus the burden of the climate crisis on every single human being. Therefore, a political commentary is lacking in the article as we are fed all this information but not told who directly is the culprit. As people understand who is in large part of the climate crisis, socio political relations are deeper understood, and we are not left with a 'now what'.

While reading "The Uninhabitable Earth," it truly dawned on me how bleak the future of the Earth looks. From simply death by heat to poisoning of our oceans, Wallace-Wells addresses nine major threats and possibilities of catastrophe for our planet, and each is validated by clear evidence that humans' poor treatment of our atmosphere and planet is leading us to our extinction (In particular, "permanent economic collapse" was the most alarming outcome, as our world could easily be thrown into anarchy atop the other likely outcomes). While this realization I made was fairly horrific, it was accurate. I think it is very well understood that after reading this article, one could be incapacitated by fear, accepting the fate of the planet, however I don't think Wallace-Wells statements were conclusive in any way. I think we should be scared of the climate crisis; but this fear should frighten us into action. It may take a lot of work and resources dedicated towards the issue, but we should not simply throw our hands up in dismay that we are currently on route to annihilation; we can still save the earth.

I agree with what you says about how Wallace-Wells brings an urgency with NINE major threats to the planet and humanity as a whole. The way that I see it after reading these nine points, is that unless radical changes are made, whichever way we turn, it will be off a cliff into a pit of fire. The realization that I began to make after reading this coupled with our in class lectures is that we may be too far off the cliff to even try and make a right turn in a positive direction. One point that concerns me also is the possibility of war due to the dramatic changes in the climate, the doubling of the crime rate and the difficulty of the world being able to be policed by the United States would cause places like the middle east/southwest Asia to become even more disarrayed then they already have been before. The issue is the lack of positive change, I believe that we need to take each and every one of his points to heart in the sense that if we don't do something drastic then one maybe even more of these future scenarios could be reality in the coming decades.

After reading the alarming article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, by Walace Wells I found that while he did take an extremist standpoint, I found that he effectively communicated the different turns for the worst that the Earth could take if action is not taken. I appreciated the organization of effects, and I was also intrigued at the points he brought to my attention. For instance, I believed that I had a general understanding of the effects climate change will have on society. Wells, brought to my attention the social effects such as Perpetual War. It surprised me how there was a correlation between climate change and war. He discussed how shortly after a severe drought in Syria caused by climate change, Syria was in a civil war. Wells, adds that the rising temperature will soon increase the amount of war and violence.
                <br><br>

In addition, the Climate Plagues that could occur were disturbing to read about. Not only is it concerning that the ice in the Arctic is melting but also that they would not only decrease albedo, be responsible for a rise in sea level but also unveil ancient viruses that were safely trapped in the ice. Not only does climate change affect these viruses, but also viruses that are currently present in today’s society, such as Zika. The warming climate allows the Zika virus to travel further and further northward and also reproduce faster. Overall, I felt that his tactics were necessary to continue to bring awareness to not climate change but the Climate Crisis.

In the reading “The Uninhabitable Earth”, David Wallace-Wells discusses the effects of climate change if no action is done to reduce carbon emissions. He repeatedly mentions that these scenarios would occur if no action is taken which can be interpreted as a way to emphasize the need for action rather than apathy. Although many consider him to be an alarmist, I believe that he is being more realistic than other authors that tend to use the “best case scenario” estimations when discussing the effects of climate change.
                <br><br>
He also thoroughly outlines a variety of ways climate change can affect society from the negative feedback loop caused by the melting of permafrost to global economic decline. One of the effects that caught my interest was “Climate Plagues” as it discussed how the melting of glaciers, permafrost, and other ice structures can lead to the release of deadly diseases that have been frozen in the ice for long periods of time. Diseases that our immune systems have no way to fight such as smallpox and the bubonic plague can be released and spread at a ridiculously fast pace with the help of globalization. I thought this was very intriguing as most people don’t think of the spread of disease as a consequence of climate change but instead focus primarily on rising sea level and droughts. Even though more people become educated about climate change everyday, not enough have been pushed into taking action as they do not understand the severity of the situation we’re in. David Wallace-Wells does an excellent job highlighting the true danger of climate change and the urgent need for action.

David Wallace Wells’ New York Times article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” provides new insight on the biggest issue surrounding climate change– many people think that just because we cannot physically see it, it’s not actually happening. The ignorance surrounding this subject is infested with people who share this same mindset, along with those who frankly just do not care because their president said so. For me in particular, I was stunned on how uneducated I was on how climate change actually affects every part of our lives, not just our physical environment. The most surprising of these effects is that the melting ice glaciers do not only pose a threat to polar bears– it is an immediate threat to our health and well being. In the article, Walls states, “Ice works that way, too, as a climate ledger, but it is also frozen history, some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen.” This statement completely astounded me and made me rethink what I thought I knew about the climate crisis. Much like the planetary history of rock, the Arctic ice holds the detrimental secrets of the past– many prehistoric plagues, which have not circulated in the air for millions of years, have made their way back into the forefront of, “who can kill the most people first?” I don’t think anyone truly understands the weight climate change has on our everyday lives, especially because it is not physically seen. It has the ability to alter every single part of our lifestyle by amplitudes and there is no way we can stop it without millions of people succumbing to its repercussions. Although news is spreading about its repercussions through the recent disasters around the world, many still believe that it is ‘fixable’, when in reality, the truth is that we “found a way to engineer our own doomsday”. The fires in Australia, the hundreds of recurring hurricanes in Puerto Rico, or the volcano eruption in the Philippines, are forcing innocent people to uproot their lives through trauma, and it is all our fault. The “uncertainty about uncertainty” is the perfect way to describe our future.

After reading the article, my idea of the severity of the climate crisis has evolved in a way that rightly makes me immensely uncomfortable. Before joining this class and reading this article, I was aware of and believed in the degradation of the climate due to carbon dioxide emissions and various other greenhouse gases, as I had previously done a presentation on climate change, but I was not fully aware of the dire situation that the planet is already in. I had assumed, naively, that the warnings and alarms raised about our dying climate were warning about an event bound to come a century or two later, and that, at the moment, our climate was unhealthy, but stable and repairable. After learning, however, about the failed Paris agreement and the current incredibly high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere at 415 ppm, I realized how wrong that idea of a safe, repairable climate for the remainder of the century is. In reality, our climate could well become uninhabitable within the next century, as shown by David Wallace-Wells’s roadmap for a world without significant, borderline universal human action towards limiting CO2 emissions.
                <br><br>


Regarding the question of whether or not David Wallace-Wells is an alarmist, I don’t believe so, as an alarmist is someone who raises unnecessary fear. In the case of reverting the climate crisis, this fear and alarm is far from unnecessary. The damage done to our planet’s climate is already farther gone than we’d ever predicted in the past decades, and as such repairing the planet’s dire condition will require nothing less than universal support from the human race. Seeing as, despite countless reports and warnings, climate change deniers and passive observers still either refuse to see the danger or fail to act, any means of effectively raising awareness and prompting action are necessary in the cause of preserving the climate. Reading about James Hansen’s studies on Venus, in which uninhabitable Venus is revealed to be the end product of a deadly process of climate change, one very similar to the one facing Earth, shook me to my core. Universal action is necessary, and so the alarm that Wells raises is necessary as well.

As someone who hasn't gone out of their way to research the effects of climate change, this article has really had a profound impact on me. I've always seen the headlines about temperatures rising to unprecedented highs, but never really understood why this was an urgent issue aside from the rising sea levels.  I thought that the increase in economic prosperity and global trade was a fair trade off for an increase of a degree or two. However, the way that this article highlights all the other issues that will directly arise from this phenomenon. such as famine and disease outbreaks, has helped me understand the urgency of the situation. Furthermore, his explanation of the astronomical amounts of carbon under the icecaps that will be released and make any attempts to lower our induced CO2 concentration pointless has made it apparent to me that we are actually in a state of crisis. As someone in a STEM major, this article helped me understand things in more logical terms: we have a self regulating system that we are pushing beyond the critical point. Even if we can't say for sure when that critical point will be achieved, the fact that the rate of change at which we release CO2  is itself increasing is an urgent call to action. The system that I'm referring to is the entirety, something I had not realized before, of our ecological ecosystem. For example: once the air is polluted, the water will acidify and in turn kill our marine life. His article has also helped me understand the degree of the impact on our economic system that climate change will have through less food production and mass migrations. As someone who would have previously been skeptical of the title of this article, I can no longer think that climate activism is in anyway alarmism and nor is this author an alarmist.

This article had specific consequences of our actions and warned of the many ways that the climate crisis would end in mass dying through many different factors. The severity of the consequences was used to maybe scare us into taking action. The way it's written helps the reader see that it is inevitable if we stay our course and keep speeding up climate change. If the fossil fuel industry is so interested in gaining revenue, how would they gain revenue in the future when climate change has made the Earth uninhabitable as soon as a hundred years from now. I guess it's the CEOs and higher ups of the company getting that money and they wouldn't care if humans die off because by that time they'll have already died. There are so many consequences of climate change and it's crazy to know that some people don't "believe" in it. I felt scared imagining an Earth as it was described in the article and I think it did a good job giving straight facts of the course that we're headed towards even if the climate crisis was addressed immediately.

Communicating the urgency and importance of taking action to mitigate the effects of climate change is a challenging task to undertake. Often the bleak and depressing nature of the subject is enough to push people into a state of denial or hopelessness. However, people should not be spared from the austere truths about the impacts and future of anthropogenic climate change.

                <br><br>

For this reason, I appreciated the rhetorical style David Wallace-Wells uses in his Article The Uninhabitable Earth. While it is quite pessimistic, and at certain points fatalistic, Wells draws from numerous accredited sources to provoke a sense of both fear and motivation in his readers. With the significance and time sensitivity of the climate crisis I think this approach is completely justified. Although undoubtedly some readers will be put off by the bleakness of the article, I believe the vast majority will finish the article, as I did, wanting to do something to change the terrible path we have sent our planet down.
                <br><br>


I found the subsection of the article centered around the loss of arable land and subsequent increase in famines and starvation particularly troubling. It's important to recognize that the impacts of climate change will not be felt equitably, the people at the lowest rungs of the social ladder will be affected the most. It was passages like these, that illustrate the social costs of climate change, that made me feel most motivated to take action.

“The Uninhabitable Earth,” by David Wallace-Wells addresses the issue of climate change in―what some might say―an aggressive manner. As Wallace expresses his concerns, it clear that he wishes to create a sense of urgency through invoking fear and feelings of endangerment within his audience. This approach of overwhelming the reader with alarming information conjures feelings of panic in order to warn the reader of today’s time-critical issues regarding global warming. Wallace presents statistics that put these issues into perspective and on a scale that helped me to understand the severity of what global warming has done to our planet and what will happen in the future if we fail to take action. Reference to the time in which the Earth is likely to become inhabitable gives the reader an understanding of how little time there is left relative to their lifespan. 
                <br><br>
I was most alarmed by the fact that the melting of permafrost is a reality that will result in the release of 1.8 trillion tons of carbon which can potentially evaporate as methane. Wallace repeatedly reminds the reader that he or she is not fully aware of the issues at hand, how concerned they should be, and the degree of impact these changes can have on our planet. This recurring point may come off as demeaning, but after reading the article, I did feel as though I was unaware of many aspects and what may result of climate change in the future. Wallace addresses many potential consequences of the damage we have done to the planet’s equilibrium including drought, disease, damage to ecosystems, poor air quality, war, economic collapse, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and on. 
                <br><br>
Wallace makes clear and well-defined arguments that use more than just an appeal to endangerment. While I do agree that Wallace’s argument is effective and that his rhetorical approach is necessary, I am led to wonder whether this article may leave more people feeling hopeless and accepting of the demise of planet Earth rather than optimistic of the changes they are able and are willing to make.

I found "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells to be an interesting read. Especially after reading the beginning paragraphs I did find it to be on a negative note, but as I continued to read, I understood what David was trying to get his readers to understand. Thus, I think he did an amazing job explaining situations in which our world is leading to because of the climate change. As he was describing how our world could lead to these dramatic and harsh realities, I found myself visualizing the situation, so I definitely enjoyed what he had to say. I was aware of the fact that this climate crisis could be the end of our earth and can lead to the 6th extinction, yet I wasn't aware of all the situations that David had mentioned. For example, I learned that ice melting doesn't only release trapped Co2 into our atmosphere but also trapped diseases that have not been circulated in the air for millions of years. Meaning, some of these diseases entering our air have not existed since humans were around to encounter then; thus our immune systems have no idea how to fight against these foreign diseases. More over, I also learned about the term "the Great Filter" and how a civilization rises here on our earth, but then there's an environmental filter that causes the civilization to die off. I found this to be interesting and I could only think about the previous 5 extinction events and how 4/5 were because of climate change produced by greenhouse gases. Could we be the 6th extinction? After seeing and hearing all the environmental disasters that have happened in such a short period because of climate change-- to think that "we are at war with the planet, we have provoked it for too long, not its out to get us" can be a scary thought. However, a part of me does have hope that it will all be okay, and I am glad to be in a class devoted to the climate crisis and to be in a room with 800 other minds that find the climate crisis to be a huge problem that needs to be faced and controlled.

To answer Ken’s question, I think Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth” certainly gives a demand to take action by portraying the current climate crisis as the grim reality it is. With sections named “Doomsday” and “The End of Food,” it is clear to me why many would see Wells as an alarmist. However, as the rise of natural disasters such as the recent Australian and Californian wildfires show, it’s crucial for us not to dismiss his article because he is simply delivering a very possible reality. As Ken’s seven facts show, climate crisis requires immediate action, and failing to accept this will only cause us more problems in the future. Although some may argue that Well’s pessimistic portrayal of the possible future may leave readers feeling defeated and unmotivated to jump to action, I think he did a good job balancing out startling realities with calls to action. As the sentences like “now we’ve found a way to engineer our own doomsday, and surely we will find a way to engineer our way out of it, one way or another” suggests, Wells lists the alarming consequences of human action to lead into his argument that all hands are needed on deck, for both governments and individuals, in order to successfully implement solutions.

One small part of the article that made me think about climate change a little differently was David Wallace-Wells’ breakdown of the reasons for climate inaction. I have always thought that people who believe in climate change are working to fix it and climate deniers are not, but I realized that people who are aware of the crisis are sometimes just so overwhelmed with fear that they do nothing at all. Sometimes I find myself in that situation, but I’ve never really heard anyone talk about it. 
                <br><br>

 In a broader sense, this article was a call to action for me. I have read plenty of pieces about the reality of the climate crisis, but this one stood out from the others. Statistics and predictions can sometimes be a little dry and meaningless, but combined with real world examples like the virtually hopeless cases of Bangladesh and Florida made it easier to understand how real the climate crisis is. Additionally, the explanations of how every area of life will be affected by global warming was very effective. Usually we think about rising sea levels and warmer weather when discussing climate change, but David Wallace-Wells informs us of the fate of the economy, food supply, and world peace, among other things.

After becoming more informed about the dangers our world is approaching through "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I have concluded that some of these scenarios Wallace Wells lists are inevitable. In this article, Wells explains all the possible scenarios and coming consequences that will occur if we continue to release CO2 into our atmosphere at an alarming rate. After reading all the different profound impacts climate change could have on us, I wouldn't call him an alarmist as many scientists are naming him. The truth is Wells is trying to give us a wake up call by explaining the way our daily lives will be impacted in the years to come. As he explains, human activity alone has warmed the Earth by one degrees celsius which is already 1/2 alone of the 2 or more degrees celsius warming of our Earth that we don't want to reach. I feel prompted to take action after reading this article.
                <br><br>

As said in the section "Heat Death" in Wallace Well's article, Since 1980, the plant has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat; a bigger increase is to come.The past 5 years have been the hottest ever in our planet's history. This gives me a sense of taking action because my hometown has rising temperatures every summer. Last year, there was a week with consecutive 106+ degrees F weather. I can't imagine what our world will turn into if this temperature becomes normal all around our planet. We will literally burn which will expose us to various diseases extinguishing a lot of our population. This hot weather also contributes to the fires that have been occurring in the past decade. For me, Wallace Wells definitely doesn't come off as an alarmist.

After hearing about this article and the claims that David Wallace-Wells was being too much of an alarmist I assumed that the article would be far too dramatic and would make shocking and hard to believe claims. I was pleasantly surprised to find that instead Wallace-Wells provided disclaimers and sound science behind each of his predictions. Along with this Wells also continuously reminds the reader that all of this is based upon absolutely no human intervention and we should see this as a motivation, not a death sentence. While the article did bring to light several worrisome issues about climate change that I had not even considered, such as the plagues trapped in ice that could be released during melting, it did not strike me as too alarmist. My viewpoint could be somewhat skewed as I tend to lean towards a slightly more pessimistic side of realism and was imagining even worse predictions, but overall I do not think the article should be written off. Skeptics may be put off by this article, and maybe even just its title, which could limit the audience, but realistically those people are unlikely to read any literature about climate change in the first place. 
                <br><br>


I did feel somewhat fearful after reading the article because the consequences of us not taking action would be very severe. I have rarely stopped to think about the economic or political consequences of climate change because as a chemistry major I have focused mainly on the scientific changes. This article caused me to understand that this issue goes much deeper than science and looking at only one point of view can lessen your overall understanding of this crisis. Not only will we face the problems that scientists predict but we will also see wars and economic collapse, which is completely frightening in an entirely different way. Despite these newfound anxieties I still saw the article as more of an informative call to action rather than an incapacitating list of what we should fear. I do think that some fear is necessary when discussing climate change because it is a topic that should be taken seriously and requires action rather than complacency. 

                <br><br>

The most convincing argument was the section about food scarcity. I found this to be the most effective part of Wells’ article because it touches on a topic that has always been an issue even before we started worrying about the climate crisis. People all over the world already face hunger on a daily basis so picturing an even worse future with more starving people is truly terrifying because it is so easy to imagine. It is not hard to see where Wells’ fear is coming from when he discusses dying crops and our inability to easily relocate our fields. While other parts of the article are also incredibly convincing due to the hard science backing them I found this section convincing because it is somewhat easier to comprehend than the biochemistry behind ancient plagues and the effects of hydrogen sulfide in our oceans. What we eat is also an easy place to start in terms of personal action because cutting back on our consumption of meat and dairy products, or completely devoting to veganism, can make a difference.

David Wallace Wells’s article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” was incredibly eye-opening. I have learned much about sea-level rise, plastic pollution, and carbon emissions from other documentaries and articles, but he went into even greater detail about catastrophes I had never even considered. The threat of an increase in carbon emissions from permafrost and the possible release of plagues that are frozen in ice are two potential disasters I had never heard of. I can see both sides of the argument on this article regarding its alleged alarmism. Wallace Wells presents a slew of daunting climate disasters. Without an explanation of how the average person could contribute to the cause, they seem somewhat unsolvable from the individual perspective. However, just because this information is terrifying we still must be informed. As noted in the article, climate change has already caused many deaths around the world and is currently affecting our global population, a fact many people seem to neglect. Although the beginning seems somewhat alarmist, as the article progresses it gets more optimistic and in my opinion does a good job of both shocking the reader into action while also reassuring us by saying that many climate scientists believe we will collectively find some solution. Overall, I think this article is extremely important for more people to read, so they can get an understanding of how dire and real the climate crisis is.

Personally, I do not believe Wallace Wells is too alarmist, rather he is only pointing out the facts. He is writing to the younger generations because lord knows the previous generations didn’t do anything. After reading the article, I felt sad that this is where we are at right now with the state of our planet. But also I felt a bit…. Cynical. Why shouldn’t us humans wreak the consequences. And then I remembered that any other living entity other than humans weren’t the cause of this; we weren’t even the generation to cause this, and now, we are the ones trying to pick up the pieces. 
                <br><br>


While I am not against his alarmist approach, I can see how it may alienate others. Perhaps those who are the few percent who actually contribute to the greenhouse gas emissions. The article may even alienate those who do not have access to fresh foods because they are in the middle of a food desert and have no choice in choosing the vegan option

                <br><br>

There are a plethora of reasons why someone might dismiss the alarmist tactic. For starters, these scare tactics happen all of the time; Y2K and again the end of the world was predicted in 2012. For a majority of them, these events do not occur. Other reasons may include those who are climate change deniers, those who cannot see the direct damage so they continue with their every day ‘developed world’ lives, and lastly those driven by capitalism.

One thing that I like about the article, The Uninhabitable Earth, is that it clearly lays out the consequences of talking absolutely no meaningful action on climate change. I find it really easy for me to lose track of the meaning of everything when those trying to warn us of climate change just shout a large numbers, and the whole thing just kinda just becomes too abstract for me. By warning us about the direct effects of climate change, Wallace-Wells avoids that problem by describing the large amounts of death and suffering as our planet turns into a nurturing environment and into one hostile to all life. The only thing I would prefer to this however is the author focusing more on what is already happening to signal the magnitude of climate change rather than worst case estimates that can be brushed of by a populace manipulated by climate change deniers.

According to Wallace-Well’s article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, climate change will bring forth many problems not just sea level rising. Disease older than humanity itself is trapped in the ice walls of the poles and because of the global temperature rising they can be released in a matter of a few years. Humanity will be completely defenseless to these diseases since our immune system would have no idea how to fight back. The rise in temperature would also cause devastating amounts of carbon previously trapped in permafrost to be released into the atmosphere. As the carbon evaporates, an even more powerful greenhouse gas is created, methane. Even a small increase in temperature by two degrees would be enough to displace tens of millions of people who live near coastal areas. Because of the less absorbed sunlight there will be more cloud cover which will kill off forests and flora. According to Wallace-Well, we are currently living in the 6th mass extinction that is eerily similar to one in which 97% of all species on Earth died. Even more alarming is the fact that we are currently adding more CO2 into the atmosphere than even then. Heat waves are more and more recurrent in this day and age and most people in the subtropics and desert areas are reeling from skyrocket temperatures. Soon this problem will extend to more parts of the world. By the end of the century there will be 50% more people to feed yet 50% less grain and food supply to feed the entire human population. In fact, scientists predict that by 2080, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought. The world’s oceans will be the victim of ocean acidification which will kill of most of marine life. There will also be more pollution in the air and will rise as high as 70% in the United States. It must also be acknowledged that the entire global economy is based on the burning of fossil fuels with the rise of capitalism and consumerism the main culprits. Global warming has brought us to the brink of global catastrophe, but we have only ourselves to blame.

David Wallace Wells is very blunt about the imminent threat of climate change. The statistics regarding the methane contained in the Arctic Permafrost shook me. I have heard  these before, however Wallace Wells lays the situation out very clearly, he states that this Arctic Permafrost contains twice as much carbon as is "currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet" and goes into detail about how havoc-wreaking this will be when it is released.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells I have become more aware of all the different effects that Global warming can cause. I think that All 7 of these issues are important in their own ways but to me, the one that scares me the most is Poisoned Oceans. The reasoning for this is that 75% of the earth is covered by our oceans. Water is one of the most important structures for life. With poisoned oceans, the places that depend on the oceans to live will have nowhere to go. Life will die out and coasts will be evacuated. I believe this will lead to a series of unfortunate events like people trying to migrate to bigger cities and causing lots of war. In concerns to David Wallace, I believe that he is not an alarmist ts but rather someone who is just trying to get more people to take action. His article is not meaningless and overall has a main goal to inform people about the actual danger that the earth and all its life is facing. I think this is an effective way to bring people to action and is not misleading in any way. He is simply describing to us what will happen if we continue to admit all of these greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Although they may seem scary, Its reality and we most all give an effort in trying to fix this global issue.

David Wallace-Wells’ article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” genuinely surprised me in many ways. Prior to reading the article I assumed it’d just go over the basics of climate change and reference a bunch of random sources; however, this article did much more than that.
                <br><br>
Wallace makes use of an alarmist approach to communicate his various messages, which I don’t necessarily think is a bad thing. He immediately begins the article with the sentence “ It is, I promise worse than you think.” and continues to use this pessimistic language throughout his writing. To many this tactic may cause fear and possibly drive some readers away but this is a very useful and practical method because I think all the topics he discusses are in fact things we should be fearful of, he is simply being realistic. This article really put things into perspective for me. I have been aware that the planets global temperature is rising and that our air quality is worsening but I never truly realized to what degree it is all occurring. 
                <br><br>
One of the things I found most compelling, and concerning, was the possible climate plagues that may occur due to global warming. Many diseases dating back to millions of years ago are are trapped in the arctic; however, with the melting of the ice there is a possibility that they may be released and will begin circling throughout our environment. This is something I never even thought about occurring, simply the idea of it is frightening and to think that there’s an actual possibility that plagues that killed off millions of people could be released is definitely something we should pay more attention to. 
                <br><br>
Wallace’s article definitely serves as a wake-up call as he truly puts things into perspective. As I read the article I couldn’t help but feel helpless and frightened by the severity of the climate crisis in which we are living in. However, I definitely feel better informed and think that as a society we should all strive to be more aware and conscious about climate change as well as what steps we can take to help the situation.

After reading the "Uninhabitble Earth" I felt sad. Having read all the possible outcomes of climate change (non of which are even remotely positive) I had a bit of a realisation moment. However I would not call David Wallace Wells and alarmist. This would require him to over-exaggerate  the danger of a situation in order to cause a shock effect. Sadly enough the consequences he lists are no exaggerations but merely scientific conclusions derived from a huge amount of research. In addition to the statements not being exaggerations, Wallace Wells also does not imply that all of these grave things will certainly happend. He states that, if we don't act, these things will eventually happen. The likelihood of this happening I do not deem very high because, if your house is on fire do you wait for it to burn out completely or do you call the firefighters right away. I would suggest that we as a planet start to bring in the fire department because our house has been on fire for quite a while now.

<p>
Something I found very unusual and interesting about Wallace’s piece is that he addressed a wide variety of ways in which the earth will be affected by climate change.  Often in readings I have done, one area is focused upon, while he undertook many, if not all.  Several of his claims were about topics I had never even heard of before, or realized, for example the impact of the atmosphere on cognitive ability, the rate of crime and war, and upon the economy.  
                 <br><br>
One thing that really struck me from the article was when he mentioned the Antarctic calving.  I was in EARTH10, Antarctica, last quarter, and I had an assignment to read and respond to an article about Antarctica.  The article I chose was about the recent calving of an iceberg.  I’m not sure that this is from the same circumstance, but I assume so, and that part of the article really stuck out to me.  The rate of cracking as well, 11 miles in 6 days, is unfathomable.  
                 <br><br>
Something else I wanted to touch on was the concept of colonizing the human race on other planets.  As Wallace mentions, people like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have been suggesting that the human race must colonize elsewhere in order to balance and maintain the growth in population we have been having.  However, this concerns me.  There is no doubt in my mind that using this thought process, the human race would likely just repeat said actions on Mars, or wherever else we move to.  In fact, as he later states, the lifespan of civilization in general is likely only several thousand years, and industrialized civilization may be only several hundred.  This makes me wonder if climate change may in fact be part of the cycle of life, and be leading towards a mass extinction that is necessary.  
                 <br><br>
A final thing that Wallace discussed, was the effect of heat upon crime rate and war.  However, this seemed not to be based upon factual evidence, and made me wonder if we are able to consider this to be proof of the negative impact which climate change has on the earth.  This seems to be an instance of correlation with no proof of causation yet, and I think that may have been important for Wallace to note.  
                 <br><br>
While it may seem as though my response takes an attempt to debunk some of the things that David Wallace mentions, I did find this article to be very interesting. I learned a lot of new things that I had never even had mentioned to me before.  I consider myself to be fairly well-educated on climate change and its effects, and so it made me realize that there is a good chance much of the population doesn’t know many of the things that Wallace discusses.

While I finished reading the "Uninhabitable Earth" and watching the video, I believe David Wallace is an alarmist.  From my perspective, his article is meant to provoke people to face one reality, which is if we don't reduce the greenhouse gas emission, we will meet the end of the human. As the reading informed, the earth once had more greenhouse gas than now, and the temperature was once much higher. However, earth yet survived, but lifeforms had distinct for five times. People must find a way to save themselves. The issues he wrote sounds terrific, but all of them are things that will become true within a few years.

Out of the many surprising facts I’ve learned regarding the climate crisis, a fact I still find intriguing is that a rise of one or two degrees is enough to cause significant change and damage. According to Ken’s video, we’ve already caused a one degree rise, so the two to four degrees in the article doesn’t seem to be that far away. According to the article, a rise of eleven to twelve degrees would cause the death of more than half of the world’s population if its distribution was the same as today. Seventy degrees Fahrenheit doesn’t seem that different from eighty degrees to some people, but people should be reminded that a degree or two in Celsius, which is actually about thirty-four or thirty-six degrees in Fahrenheit, in climate change is almost enough to reach Wallace-Wells’ alarming depictions of our future.  Wallace-Wells’ article details the effects of climate change in a way that is, not attractive, but vivid and attention-getting. It explains how, although everything seems pretty acceptable to many people currently, life on Earth can experience great changes soon. 
                 <br><br>

Based on what I’ve read so far, “The Uninhabitable Earth” is my favorite article on the climate crisis. Although it has been called alarmist and depressing, I appreciate how vividly it lays out the potential consequences of a few degrees of warming. Previously, global warming meant, to the average person, sea level rises. “The Uninhabitable Earth” is great in that it lists out a variety of ways the world will be affected. The ozone hole crisis was efficiently solved in part because people felt directly threatened since almost everyone gets exposed to UV. Yet, global warming and sea rise doesn’t directly connect to most people, since not everyone lives near the coast. Without deeply thinking about it, sea rise doesn’t seem that threatening. One might think that the waves will be slightly higher, but that’s not as scary as cancer. Wallace-Well’s article is brilliant in that it explains how climate change affects more than sea level and emotionally moves more people. Perhaps someone isn’t concerned about sea level rise, but maybe they’d be concerned with unbreathable air or less food production. Getting people to understand the severity of the issue and how it directly relates to them is important in order to make people want to change, and Wallace-Wells manages to inflict a strong emotional response in many readers, which is why people call him an alarmist despite him merely conveying the importance of the issue in a successful way. 
                 <br><br>

I also think it would be interesting to see a sci-fi movie based on the article. Although the article is great at inducing emotional responses, numbers usually become just numbers. A million versus ten million doesn’t feel that different, but a death of one family member is huge. Wallace-Wells communicates the climate crisis in a great way, but films can sometimes express more emotion than the written word. Instead of glancing past how one-fifth of the population of a region in El Salvador has chronic kidney disease from heat, something briefly mentioned in the article, but disastrous for those in the region, a film would allow viewers to better understand the consequences of the climate change, possibly through bonding with carefully crafted and fictional characters. Although documentaries would be effective at conveying the current plight of certain places, a sci-fi film would effectively show how the entire world, including cities where viewers currently live, would be affected.

David Wallace Wells article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", while shocking as it mentions many possibilities that typically go undiscussed, is highly informative and incites just the right amount of anxiety about the climate crisis. I definitely would say that he pulls the scariest possibilities of the bunch in this piece in order to not only draw the attention of readers, but to make people afraid of these possible futures. Based on this article, I would not call Wallace Wells an alarmist– however, I would say that this piece is sounding an alarm. Meaning that while the issues he discusses are nothing short of terrifying, they are not stated in a way that is to incite panic, nor are they exaggerated. They are all based on sound research. This is an article that wakes people up rather than one that incapacitates readers. 

                 <br><br>
I do have a critique, and I feel as though it is a critique that I often have of articles or films that are more on the "doom and gloom" side of things: I wish that the author included helpful ways to include action in everyday life. Yes it ended on a more optimistic note, but the article gave no mention of everyday things that ordinary people can do to prevent all of these scary realities.

The Uninhabitable Earth is a scientific article written by David Wallace-Wells, which provides many valid evidences to tell people how sooner the climate crisis will affect people on the earth. It is kind of normal for people to connect the rise of sea level in their mind when talking about the global warming. Actually, a lot of people just think this situation simply. The consequences behind the sea level rising are more terrifying and shocking. For example, Wallace mentioned that the temperature rose about 60-70 degrees in North Pole in past winter, which even cause the permafrost start to melt. The rise of sea level would finally make us lose Miami and Bangladesh in the future. What’s more, the melting of permafrost can release 1.8 trillion tons of carbon in it, which is “more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s atmosphere”. The statistics of the amount of carbon really shocked me. It is hard to imagine how fast the temperature would rise if these carbon release to the air.
                 <br><br>


Besides, I think the “Heat Danger” is quite scared. Before reading this article, can you believe people possibly die because the weather is too hot. Indeed, the earth experienced five big distinction because of the extreme weather. But, the range of temperature for human surviving is so narrow. The earth can survive, human cannot. So, I think the most important goal for this article is to raise people’s awareness. Just like what Wallace said at the beginning, “the rise of sea level is very bad, but fleeing from coastline is not enough.” Escaping from problems will only bring more problems.

After reading the “Uninhabitable Earth”, by David Wallace Wells, I personally was put in a direction of fear which ultimately ensued a desire within me to make a change in what the future holds. Preceding the reading of this article, I did not have near the amount of knowledge that I do now of what is occurring in this world today. David Wallace Wells may have taken an alarmist standpoint on this subject but in doing so, it created me to be more interested in the issues at hand and what to do differently so that the earth would not meet the increase of 2 degrees in the next generation. I have the viewpoint that he knew the repercussions of taking this standpoint- risking alienating certain readers into becoming discouraged, but had a certain audience in mind. This audience, I believe, were the ones who would take this article as a cry out for action and an eye opening experience. I think he knew if those that would be frightened to action would stand up and start something the others who were discouraged would soon follow creating an overall major change in the environment today. 
                 <br><br>
All of the impacts were compelling but the one that stood out the most to me was the “poisoned oceans” portion of the article. Considering the fact that our entire world is covered by 70% of the ocean shows that if that fails then 70% of the world fails along with it. After reading the article I have the knowledge that if we continue to pollute the air as we do today then ocean acidification will rise, since ⅓ of the world’s pollution is absorbed by the ocean. The ocean will evolve into something I don’t believe we will be able to turn back one it gets there; with the major death of marine species. I am now ready to take on what it is I have to do personally for this issue to be solved.

“The inhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells basically lays us a truth of what will climate change do on us. He first reveals that many people only touch the surface of climate change. Also, writers’ poor imagination and technocrats’ denials both make people not take the climate crisis seriously so climate issue does not put on a schedule. In the following context, he emphasizes eight aspects causing by climate change and provides a clear and compelling image of changes in nature. All of the information about the disasters, the extinction of animals, and destructive influence towards human beings do not aim at causing fear or exaggerating the facts. He is not an alarmist but a teller and information collector who portraying the future for us. 
                 <br><br>

While he is presenting his argument on climate change, he uses a great amount of evidence and articles from other experts to illustrate his points. For example, in the second part of his article, he talks about heat death. He mentions an example from Europe: “In 2003, the European dead wave rises four degrees and, in that year, 2000 people died of the extreme heat every day.” Specific dates and numbers are well-used in his article and because of his objective description, he does not make me want to sit down and cry but read his article carefully and critically. I think about the heatwave in my hometown and related news about climate change that I’ve known before. His purpose is also not to make everyone emotional but to realize and to have actions. 
                 <br><br>

Heat Death can be the most compelling consequence. He uses data from other experts and IPCC and examples like tropical forests in Costa Rica, Europe, and the Middle East. The high temperature has caused nature and people living in threats. He points out that humans and most mammals have a narrow temperature range to live. The point makes sense to audiences. For most people living in the mainland away from coastal areas, tornados and hurricanes are distant objects for them while the heat in summer is much easier to touch for them. As for me, I feel hotter year by year and the air conditioner is necessary for me or I am uncomfortable in summer. 
                 <br><br>

An interesting situation that he points out is not many people take the issue seriously. Despite that many scientists and volunteers have written articles or made videos to alert the world, most of people still do not realize the crisis. Some people think that others can protect the earth for me and others soon forget it and continue their lifestyles. We do not need to totally change our lives but any tiny promotions can give help to the earth. I believe that continuing education on climate change and climate promotion is necessary because the population base is huge and a project of facing climate change is also huge.

After I read the “uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells, I was shocked by Wallace’s alarmist sense. With the true examples of “heat death”, “the end of Food”, “climate Plague, unbreathable air, perpetual war, and Economics collapse that Wallace have stated. I think it is reasonable for us to make everything we do in daily life change into a greenway. For example, we can drive to school less and pick up our student ID to go to school, decreasing the time on smoking and say no to Carbonic heater products…. Doing these things is not simply just for us, but for the next generation as well.
                 <br><br>
However, I want to disagree with the alarmist altitude that Wallace pinpoints for the whole research. It is true that our mother earth is facing climate change and global warming terribly and there will be thousands of nightmares confronting us. However, convicting people by showing the negative perspectives things is not practical to solve. we still can feel the impacts on us, and it is reasonable for us to live just a little " more greenly". We truly want not only us but also our offspring to live peacefully. But with a passive mood to solve the environmental problem is not the best way to work. Figuring out the puzzles by starting to change some bad habits from daily life. Sooner or later, our earth will be recovered. Just keep on with positive vibes to face the environmental difficulties.

After reading David Wallace-Wells article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I have gained a new perspective on the consequences of climate change; and while it is an extreme perspective, I think it is a refreshing one that is needed to really show the gravity of the situation, and to warn us that these outcomes could actually be our future. The entire article is aided by the fact that it is supported by scientists and a wide range of facts for each topic addressed. Had the massive amounts of evidence and support not have been provided, this article would sound too alarmist, and the message would ultimately fall flat and be quickly disregarded. As someone who values evidence and reasoning, Wallace-Wells does an excellent job at making each of these situations feel real and almost inevitable. Unfortunately, I do think that to some the article might sound too nonsensical, and they may not believe what he is trying to say until these things actually start happening. Hopefully we will be able to prevent cases as extreme as those presented if we act quickly enough.

                 <br><br>

Out of all the scenarios presented, the most compelling for myself were: air becoming literally not breathable, and why people are blind to climate change and its consequences. As for air pollution, this is a reality that people are already living with. Wallace-Wells provides a fact that at a carbon dioxide concentration of 1,000 ppm, human cognitive ability drops by 21%. This is a huge decline in our ability to focus, problem solve, and perform even basic tasks. If our brain function were to decline, how would we even be able to solve complex problems such as climate change? If it did get to this point, it might be too late to turn back. Concentrating on any task would be difficult and require brain power we might not even be capable of anymore. Our bodies and brains would suffer tremendously, and it would be our fault. This ties into the problem that people just can’t seem to wrap their heads around how much of a problem climate change really is. I feel as though for most people, life is spent just trying to get by more or less. We spend time trying to educate ourselves, work to make money in order to live, get food to sustain ourselves, and trying to form meaningful relationships. Doing all of these requires a lot of time and effort, which means that people just don’t have the time to think about climate change or what they can do to help it, they are just trying to get by day to day. It is unfortunate, but this is how our society currently operates, and it will be a difficult task to collectively switch people’s mindset about how to live in a way that promotes a well-rounded life for all people, not just ourselves. I hope it does not take any of these extreme scenarios for people, our government, and the world to recognize that we need to all work together, and we all need to care about each other in order to implement lasting changes that will prevent further destruction of our world.

The article by David Wallace-Wells describes the different ways that earth is affected by climate change. He separates his article into several different sections, with each section detailing the possible consequences of climate change: heat death, plagues, unbreathable air, economic collapse, and even war. In his first section, “Doomsday,” he describes how not much has been done so far to alleviate the problem of climate change, and that the temperatures can rise by nearly eight degrees Celsius if we don’t try to stop it. While war and total economic collapse seem like far-fetched consequences of climate change, it does promote his alarmist stance and how severe of a problem climate change is. 
                 <br><br>


I thought that the article was a very eye-opening read and I even felt a bit overwhelmed about how terrible the climate situation is. While I have already learned a lot about climate change due to the prior English 22 class, I learned many new facts from reading this article. While I do agree that Wallace-Wells is taking an alarmist stance, I think it is justified considering the severity of the matter. Climate change is a serious threat to the world and all the species that live on it, so we must take action immediately to solve it. Wallace-Wells’ alarmist stance is a necessary force in provoking people into action.

<p>
Wallace-Wells’s article offers a striking perspective on the consequences of unchecked climate change, and does so effectively by offering data from various scientists in the field. However, while the article was informative and offered a more extreme perspective on the consequences of our actions when it comes to climate change, this tone also hinders the message that should come across. The doomsday-style visuals could sound slightly too far fetched for people to believe, and make the whole situation sound almost ridiculous despite the evidence offered, rather than spur readers into action. An example of something that is hard to imagine is people literally being cooked to death from the inside and out from extreme heat, as Wallace-Wells notes. For myself however, the article does show that these outcomes are entirely plausible should we continue down this destructive path, and it does make me want to take action and help others take action. But, overall I do think that the article does risk alienating certain people due to its language and the examples given to try and warn readers that climate change is real, and it is in fact, a crisis.
                 <br><br>

Some of the most compelling facts/scenarios Wallace-Wells gives are pertaining to hidden diseases and warfare. I had not yet heard of the possibility that thousands of year-old diseased could be trapped under ice and permafrost, and could inevitably be released into the population and wreak havoc on the earth’s populace. While the scientists do note that many won’t survive once thawed, it is still unsettling to know that these diseases lie dormant, waiting for their chance to infect and spread. As warfare is concerned, this is a scenario that seems rather likely, especially given our global economy. Should resources get depleted it would only be a matter of time until countries or businesses place monopolies on resources, forcing people to fight over what little there is. And in a doomsday-type world, I feel as though people would only fight over resources, not try to work together to help the world as a whole. If the largest countries suffer economic collapse, there will surely be a devastating domino effect on the rest of the world.
                 <br><br>

Wallace-Wells has made me consider more about climate change than I had before, and has made me think hard about how all of the scenarios presented are interconnected, and how they could all affect one another. While I hope these examples are never actually realized in our world, I do think we could easily see the beginnings of most of them should we remain complacent. Nothing is too far fetched when the entire world is at stake. Everything must be considered.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells is certainly the most intensive, thorough, and unsettling article regarding climate change and its potential consequences that I have read, despite similar pieces of information about the climate crisis being accessible and publicized on all platforms for as long as I can remember. Prior to reading Wallace-Wells' piece, I assumed that much of what was going to be included in the article was the dangers, theories, and predictions that I was already "aware" of. However, scenarios like “The Climate Plague”, “Unbreathable Air”, and “Heat Death” are fresh and alarming takes on the current climate crisis and its disastrous potential. Although “The Uninhabitable Earth” often takes on a pessimistic, demoralizing tone -- discounting any human ingenuity-- I think it is effective in unnerving and compelling the reader to potentially approach the climate crisis with more seriousness and initiative. Ultimately, this article showed me that my "awareness" was not just that. 

                 <br><br>

An alarmist is designated as someone who excessively exaggerates a real or imagined (predicted) threat. Although the article includes some “alarmist” undertones, I do not think it is in fair judgment to consider Wallace-Wells’ approach as unwarranted or invalid, not only because of the very legit possibilities/consequences reflected in the data but because of the reality and emergence of the climate crisis movement today, which is a community backed by millions across the world. IV. Climate Plagues and VII. Permanent Economic Collapse were definitely the most interesting and worrisome on the list of Doomsday scenarios. The idea of prehistoric diseases being released on humans along with the collapse of probably our most beloved and essential mechanism are very frightening inferences. I think it is very interesting to consider the question as to whether or not an alarmist approach risks alienating certain readers (easily dismissing alarmists). In the case of the climate crisis, especially considering the validated potential consequences of our current trajectory, “The Uninhabitable Earth” does more good than bad. This article did not “incapacitate” me with fear, instead, it has compelled me to recognize and condemn my dismissiveness of the issue.

After reading the "Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I was left with much knowledge about the dangers of the climate crisis.  It began by stating how when you think of global warming you think of the ice melting creating sea level rise.  And this causes many places to be underwater.  While this may be true, this is only the tip of the ice.  There is a vast amount of different things that can and will happen if it occurs.  While reading the "Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I learned about what will happen if this crisis were to occur, which in fact is already happening, and is rapidly progressing.  Something that I did not  know about and found very interesting was the "Climate Plagues."  I did not know that there were actual diseases millions of years old frozen, waiting to be thawed out.  This is very alarming because if those diseases were to get released then it would be very bad.  Since the diseases are frozen they are being preserved, and us as humans have never been exposed to them before.  Because of this our immune systems have no way of defending against it let alone counter them.  These diseases whom we know nothing about can be very deadly and leading to many deaths.  Due to the fact that since we have never been exposed to them we do not have a cure or a way to fight them off.  As well as, I did not know that the mass extinctions were due to greenhouse gases.  I found this very interesting because it shows us as humans how dangerous these greenhouse gases can be.  Given the fact that they are part of the reason for the mass extinctions.  I believe this article by David Wallace is very important because it is a wake up call to us, to do something and quickly before it is too late.

Reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” was more shocking than I thought it was going to be. I realized I was not truly aware of the consequences that can arise from the climate crisis. I knew it was bad but reading the multiple disastrous and real possibilities is eye-opening, The article is quite an alarmist one, but I believe that tone provides a level of urgency that is required for people to finally make changes. All the pessimism can feel overwhelming, but it does make one think and want to make a change before we reach a level where we no longer can turn back around. I can see how taking an alarmist stance can push away readers, but I do see the usefulness in it. I think the end of food is the most compelling consequence because people see temperatures rising and air pollution continuing today and there still are people who do not believe the climate crisis is that big of a deal. If they were to realize and imagine a future where the food supply is low, and affecting people in devasting ways, then perhaps that could push more people to want to change.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, there is definitely a sense of overwhelming uncertainty that sets in. The thought of multiple aspects of society, that we depend on, collapsing due to the exponential CO2 increases in recent industrial years leaves one to be rather unhopeful for the future. On top of the obvious harm that climate change can do, such as heat/temperature related deaths, Wells details how everything from ocean acidification to crippled economies to emotional tolls on the general public to even century old diseases being re-born is only inevitable. Wells goes on to describe these effects for a majority of the article, and ends with the idea that we will eventually be fine, because humans will have no other choice to engineer a solution out of it. As he puts it, "Now we’ve found a way to engineer our own doomsday, and surely we will find a way to engineer our way out of it, one way or another" suggesting that no matter what stage we get it to, we as a society will be able to use the human ingenuity to dig ourselves out of the enormous problem that we are currently presented with. 

                 <br><br>

I think that in a certain sense, Wells can be alarmist in the way that he presents his case, since for a majority of the article one is only further and further reminded of the increasing odds against us as humans. However, I do not think that his ideas are alarmist or far-fetched to a great extent, as even I, merely a student here at UCSB was able to follow his logic and see the argument at its fullest. For me personally, Wells' most frightening effect for the climate crisis has to be the poisoned oceans. Sure things like not being able to breathe and increasingly dangerous weather seem like easy answers, but the idea of the ocean getting more acidic and eventually unable to sustain life or even be touched is quite scary. Not only is UCSB an ocean-bordering school, but being a coastal native my whole life, seeing such a massive body of water being unable to be enjoyed the way it can be now seems like losing such a large part of both myself and the world.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace Wells, I was shocked by the facts he mentioned in the article. Specifically, global warming and too much emission of greenhouse gases cause climate change these days, especially in recent decades. The rising sea level makes some areas become uninhabitable. Global average temperature raises a lot without expectation. The air condition becomes worse and worse. Because of an increasing acidity of ocean, many kinds of marine animals and corals can not make their life in the water. In the future, the situation will become so serious that people can not live on the Earth anymore.

                 <br><br>

Wallace Wells did a good job by showing tons of scientific analysis to his audiences that climate change is bad for our future and it should be attributed to human activities. As the advent of the age of Anthropocene, people burn fossil fuels to produce electricity and other energy, use cars as transportation, and raise livestock–like cows–for food, etc. All of these activities result in a large amount emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are the main reasons of climate change. The author also talked about catastrophic effects. For example, famine because of a lack of food, perpetual wars, and a permanent economic collapse. His reasons are persuasive because he employs a lot of data in his writing.

                 <br><br>

All in all, the article serves as a warning. If we still do not make any change, our planet will be destroyed by ourselves. The article does not instill a sense of fright into humankind, but inform and motivate audiences about the issue of climate change effectively. To be honest, I am not a person who saves energy and protects the environment every day. However, after reading this article, I will try my best in my daily life and try to affect people around me with my actions.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth", I have realized that there is so much more to learn about climate change and its effects. Before I started the article, I assumed that it would cover the well-known effects like polluted air and oceans, inefficient soil for crops, and rising temperatures. What I did not expect were the paragraphs about plagues, wars and economic collapses. I had never realized that viruses and disease could stay trapped in ice for hundreds of years and still be active when thawed. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing when a disease will be released into the air, and if we allow the ice to melt passed illnesses that we have never encountered, we will have no way to combat them. Wallace Wells also outlines the fact that climate change could lead to an increase in violence; people will be more irritable due to increased temperatures, droughts, a decrease in food, etc. While I think that there will be slightly more hostility towards others due to the situation at hand, it is hard to believe that "social conflict could more than double this century" (13). I feel that most effects described in the article are valid, this one seems to be more on the alarmist side. Another effect that I had not thought about was an economic collapse; after thinking about it, a damaged economy does make sense, but it would not be the first thought that comes to mind. I am more worried about survival rather than the economy, and if we can overcome climate change first, then it would be time to talk about the economy. 

                 <br><br>

Overall, I believe that David Wallace Wells does an excellent job detailing climate change and the severe effects that it could cause if we do not take immediate action. I do think that some of the events that he described were over exaggerated, but the article as whole was strong. I was also a nice change of pace when he added a bit of hope at the end; I do not think it would have worked in his favor if the entirety of the article was negative. I would definitely recommend this article to anyone who is trying to learn more about climate change.

After reading David Wallace Wells' article, The Uninhabitable Earth, I would call him an alarmist as he truly is trying to get his readers to be scared enough for the current path we are on to make a change. I do not see being an alarmist as a negative thing, despite the word's negative connotation. We should all be afraid of what we are doing to our Earth and how quickly our actions are sparking consequences. The article was split up into sections of consequences of the climate crisis, the most compelling of which I found to be IV. Climate Plagues. I found this one the most compelling for the most part because I had never thought of or heard about it. I was mostly familiar with the general idea of the other sections, granted I did not know most of the terrifying details they laid out, but with section IV, it was all brand new. I never thought about what would come out of the melting ice. The fact that diseases had already been contracted and deaths had been suffered in the United States was very unnerving. Also, although I had heard of the Zika virus and its effects, I had not linked it to the climate crisis. In all, I liked this article. It did a very good job of rationally and in an organized fashion laying out the consequences of the climate crisis. However, upon finishing the reading, I found myself feeling hopeless. I realized another extinction is inevitable and that not enough people are taking this seriously. I am seriously going to change my lifestyle due to the reading, and urgently hope others do as well, though I know it is a silly wish.

In the article "Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells alarms humans about climate change. He points out the how uninhabitable the earth will be by the end this century. Many of the disasters like hurricanes and droughts are already happening on this planet. The planet will becoming only warmer and warmer and will cause billions of deaths. The biggest factor of climate change is fossil fuels and China and the U.S are the two countries that release the most Carbon dioxide into the air. What alarmed me the most was the fact that there will be disaster after distastes that will wipe mostly all of the human populations if actions to this problem are not being down. Cities near the coast like Miami will disappear by the end of the century. Before reading this article I knew climate change was a problem but I was unaware as to how alarming it is, and the only ones responsible for all this are humans. We have created this and have not done anything to solve the problem instead we speak about and we do not act on it. There will not be enough food for the future generations due to the drought on major countries where the vast majority of our produce comes from. When bubonic ice melts the prehistoric plagues that were in the ice will be let out and human's immune systems will have no idea how to fight them back. The air will become unbreathable and will suffocate millions of humans. 
                 <br><br>
After reading the article I am now well aware of the consequence that follow with climate change. I do not consider David Wallace Wells to be an alarmist at all. He has basically given us facts and information about disasters that are already happening for example in California we have had droughts that have lasted years. There are hurricanes throughout the world that are becoming more consistent and more powerful. Wildfires are becoming more and more vigorous due to droughts. Australia has had on of the biggest wildfires throughout the continent due to the drought they have been facing. The ones that have suffered the most are innocent animals that inhabit that rainforests. If humans who are more capable of finding new resources to live will die what will happen to the defenseless animals who depend on the earth's resources. The article slapped me in the face to do something, every action counts for our future and the future of our future generations.

As I read the first paragraph of the article “The Habitable Earth,” I realized how I ignorant I was to the effects of climate change. This article has opened my eyes to other dangers of climate change besides sea levels rising and earth becoming warmer. Such as, food becoming scarce because those countries that feed most of the world will no longer be able to due to drought. Running out of food is not the only worry us humans have, as the Arctic ice melts it releases prehistoric plagues that have been trapped in. That is what scares me the most as our bodies are not immune to these diseases. What also scares me is that Broecker believes that “no amount of emission reduction alone can fully help avoid disaster.” So what will? What will it take for people to take this crisis seriously. 
                 <br><br>

This article discusses various possible disasters that can lead to the end. 
                 <br><br>
What made it easier for the reader to read the article with this amount of information were the subtitles. As they give the reader an idea of what will be discussed. The author broke down each disaster and discussed it with great detail which made the article more interesting even though it discusses such a dark topic.

While feeling glad to hear about the cooperation between the 196 nations to deal with the global warming issue, I am actually more concerned about this environmental problem. In fact, it is an issue that is faced by all of the human, not just one single entity, one nation, or just one group of people. It cannot be achieved only by the facial communication throughout different countries, but by the commitment made by everyone of us. After reading the article” The Uninhabitable Earth”, I could have a better understanding of the seriousness of this issue by his qualitative, statistical demonstration.
                  <br><br>

Juxtaposing the numbers which simply shows soaring temperature rise compared to the past, Wallace-wells is trying to alarm that this problem is far more severe than we have ever thought. He illustrated the horrible consequences of global warming issue, in addition to the destruction of environment. There are also various effects on humanities, for instance the economic collapse, pollutions for the air we breathe, potential diseases and so forth.
                  <br><br>

Unfortunately, this environmental issue has not become a really major subject for the majority of people in the world. It is understandable and impossible for us to persuade everyone in this world to agree with our perspective, and deal with the situation. However, we really need people like Wallace to give us such information so that more people may be swayed to help us! We should try as much as our efforts to save the environment, the earth, our home.

While reading the “Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace Wells, I realized the actual current dire situation the earth and its inhabitants are in. I thought that I had a good understanding of the current situation the Earth is in, after watching various documentaries showcasing the effect climate change has on various life on Earth. I knew that climate change was very real and was affecting the Earth, but I hadn't known the scope of the damage and the damage that is to come if immediate changes aren't made soon.
                   <br><br>

The article presented many facts and statistics that I hadn't known that were very shocking and action inspiring. I find that although many people are aware of climate change, we often forget the severity and the reality of the situation. We are easily distracted by other societal news, like celebrity breakups. While this isn't necessarily bad, it can take away from the attention the environment needs. Another shock was that I hadn't realized that masses of humans were dying from the heat of climate change. I knew people were affected by changes in temperature caused by climate change, but it had never occurred to me that in combination with poor living and working conditions, thousands could die. certainly knew that animals and plants were becoming endangered, but it was news to me that masses of people were dying, such as when the article mentioned the sugarcane region of El Salvador. 
                  <br><br>

I certainly do not think Wells is being too alarmist, I agree with his distress and need for action. Fear is a good tactic to persuade people. People know how to help the environment, even in the littlest of ways, like properly recycling and sorting trash or taking shortened showers, what is lacking is a driving force to make people do it. Fear can certainly be ineffective if applied incorrectly, but in this case, where there is a dire issue and solutions to the issue, fear was a good way to get the point across. This article has inspired me to act and to inform others.

Wallace Wells' "The Uninhabitable Earth" discussed how our planet would look like if humans did not take action on climate change. He then touches on how important and far-reaching this climate crisis is. What I liked the most about the reading was Wallace's reference to the "Anthropocene," a term that is now being used to describe the era of humans and how their existence is attributable to the steep climb in carbon emissions.  
                  <br><br>


I felt that Wallace did not come off as overly alarmist. I believe that his delivery was potent and effective--the climate crisis is real and inaction will lead to irreversible change to our ecosystems. While Wallace's writing does evoke some "doom-and-gloom" emotions, I believe that the writings will still call people to action. For the uninitiated, Wallace's "The Uninhabitable Earth" serves to be a wake-up call. After reading the article, people who are otherwise indifferent about the climate crisis will become more cognizant of the urgency and dangers of the crisis.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells I would argue that because the author acknowledged that the events he described would unlikely all occur in our future, he was not being too alarmist. The issue of climate change is a very dire situation that needs immediate action to prevent the worst events from occurring, so getting the information out to the public on how warming can affect the Earth is necessary in any form. Although I do not believe that Wallace-Wells was being too alarmist I could understand how some readers may have felt overwhelmed by unfortunate possibilities rather than motivated to make change after reading this article. I personally felt sad and guilty for the future generations who will inhabit this Earth if we do not take immediate action to prevent further damage and warming. While this article brought up many distressing possibilities, I felt prompted to action and it reassured me in my decision to study environmental studies, educating myself on the topic and learning how I can make a change locally and globally. Although I felt motivated to take action, I again would argue that taking an alarmist approach may alienate some readers whose climate anxiety may get the best of them. Also, this approach may be ineffective for readers who are unfamiliar with the subject as this article would have been, in my opinion, to much information to digest all at once. Yes, it is important to get this information out to the masses but there may be better tactics in doing so. This alarmist tact may be the best way to spark change in some readers but may risk overwhelming others and make them feel as if it is to late for them to do anything. Also, taking an alarmist approach as mentioned is often challenged by climate change skeptics. Wallace-Wells, a definite alarmist, uses this approach in an effective manner I think because he recognizes that not all of the situations he describes will happen, but still informs his readers of all the dangers and how and why they would occur.

I was immediately shocked after reading David Wallace-Wells’ article "The Uninhabitable Earth". His article provided a lot of eye-opening information about climate change. Wallace-Wells is definitely not alarmist in this article. Wallace-Wells' concerns are completely valid and relevant, and his concerns should not be considered as inferior or completely reduce his credibility. In my opinion, everyone should be even more shocked when it comes to climate change. I think that because the author's views on climate change are more emotional, his information will not be as popular as other articles because he focuses on negative issues. As we can see in his article, climate change is a very serious problem, and if we can make any type of change, the situation will be imporved.
                  <br><br>

This article raises many of the consequences of climate change that I didn't know about. I am extremely shocked and interesting that several diseases are currently exposed to ice due to global warming. It is frightening to think of all the terrible diseases that used to kill and harm many people and animals. Also, the article made me realize that many people (include myself) have eliminated the crisis of climate change, so more action and attention is needed on this critical issue.
                  <br><br>

However, the author is not trying to make us feel frustrated about the future, but to take action and invite us to go out and do something in the world to solve this catastrophic problem we face.

In David Wallace-Wells’ article “The Uninhabited Earth,” he constructed whole article with one question: what the earth and our lives would be like, if we do not act quickly. He tried to alarm people about climate crisis by listing the consequences of rising global temperatures. To be honestly, although I knew the phenomenon of global warming and the fact that it will bring harmful impacts, I have no idea about how serious and urgent it is before reading this article. 
                  <br><br>

After reading David Wallace-Well’s article, I was scared by the future he described. He painted pictures of disasters that caused by climate change. It is an effective way to warn people what will happened, if we still ignore the phenomenon of rising global temperature and don’t take action immediately. Due to some terrible scenarios he depicted in this article, some readers considered him as an alarmist. However, I don’t think so. It is no way to say Wallace-Well’s opinions are exaggerated or aggressive. Based on statistics and researchers, disasters he mentioned will be the consequences of climate change, if we don’t change our ways of living. I believe this article is calling for action, instead of frustration for the future.

In "The Uninhabitable Earth," David Wallace-Wells paints a picture of the catastrophes and the re-making of our world in the coming years if we do not act on climate change. Some would consider his words to be over-exaggerated and would call him an alarmist because of the way he paints this crisis. It is indeed a crisis and I do not think he should be considered an alarmist because the future that he describes is indeed frightening and depressing, it is the reality that we are heading towards based on our current "business as usual." Though this could be seen as a scare tactic, it is one that could prove necessary because it will get people to take action to ensure that life on Earth does not die out. Our current system has already killed off numerous species, disrupted natural environments, and destroying the planet. Life on Earth simply cannot change with this current pace, so it is critical that we act now. It is imperative that we do something about this issue because the predicament is continuing to get worse and we are losing more time to solve it. 
                  <br><br>


Climate Change has numerous negative consequences that will affect those that contribute the least amount of greenhouse gases (those in poorer countries) versus those that are the driving factors of this issue (those in wealthier countries.) All of the consequences Wallace-Wells described in his essay are all alarming and each are the reason why we need to act on the issue. I find the unbreathable air being the most compelling reason to fight climate change because of the critical role it plays on our planet. Many species on Earth, including marine life and humans, need oxygen to breathe, which ultimately is what keeps us alive. Having more carbon in the atmosphere in the air versus oxygen would definitely disrupt ecosystems across the globe because of it's critical role in the Earth system. We would have to go through the means of making artificial oxygen, which we probably do not have the technology to do so right now. Without oxygen, our planet would turn into a lifeless rock.

After reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I initially felt depressed about the dark and gloomy future it depicted. To be candid, I initially thought this article is basically telling us “You are gonna die” by portraying a variety of environmental tragedies we are likely to face, without providing any possible solutions or suggestions, which made me feel negatively about the article. However, after reflecting and thinking about the article more carefully, I find this article instructive and valuable in that it provides a scientific, evidence-based, and rather comprehensive picture of the anthropogenic environmental damages, which is likely to trigger readers’ reflections on their lifestyles, life pursuits, and even world views, and these changes in mind are likely to lead to changes in their behaviors that can make a difference to the real world. 
                   <br><br>

This article also opens my horizon by presenting many aspects of climate change that I haven’t thought about before, such as its impacts on violence and wars and its thoughts on human race’s position in “deep time”. This article acknowledges me different associations climate change can have with human race and the significance or extent of those associations, which are some things I was not as clear before. 
                   <br><br>

I remember back in my last quarter’s Earth 2 (Geology) class, I was wondering why some scientists say that we are currently undergoing the “sixth mass extinction”. Now, I start to understand why. But what should we do about it? Try our best to protect the environment and to live sustainably are the first answers popping up in my head. Although the article doesn’t provide us with doable and practical ways to mitigate the problem, we now have a clearer understanding about the problem, a more objective view of our position in the history and universe, and hence a better preparation for action.
                   <br><br>

Finally, I understand that there are climate change deniers who may dismiss this article, but given the hard facts or realistic news such as the anthropogenic Amazon fires, it is hard to neglect the issue, so if those climate change deniers are reasonable and objective about the issue, they are likely to neutralize their views, but if they are not open to any other ideas, then it is certainly not the article’s faults and the author should not feel badly about any potentially radical comments made by them.

Having taken ENGL22 with Ken during fall quarter, I had a general idea about what "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells was going to be about—that is, an article about the impact of the climate crisis on the environment. Even with this notion in my head, the article did not fail to elicit an emotional reaction from me, as Wallace Wells' writing style is very well tailored to emphasize the urgent danger that the Earth is under. Though the article may have an "alarmist" tone, this is not necessarily a detriment, as it clearly paints out a picture as to how quickly the climate crisis is happening and the horrifying impacts it will have on our planet. The purpose of the article is to describe the horrific impacts of climate change and thus it is necessary for Wallace Wells to use such an aggressive tone. Though in ENGL22 the readings and films we read/watched were all relative to idea of preserving the environment, none of them utilize the notion of danger as effectively as this article did.

                   <br><br>

The most intriguing section of the article for me was the "heat death" section. It intrigued me because the typical negative consequence of the climate crisis that first comes to mind of any uninformed person would be global warming. In this section, Wallace Wells does a great job at expanding on this idea of heat and painting a gruesome picture of how it will play out on Earth, essentially expanding on this concept that most people generally have a surface-level understanding of.

The "Uninhabitable Earth" paints a sobering picture of the impending disasters facing the world due to climate change. While most people have likely heard that the earth is warming, I doubt that they understand just how much of an impact this will have. What I found particularly alarming was the melting of the permafrost; the fact that that ice melting will lead to way more greenhouse gasses and thus more and more warming. It is also disheartening to see that even with our best attempt to cut carbon emissions (The Paris Agreement), we still anticipate major increases in temperature. Now that we have left the agreement, I can only imagine our projections will continue to go up. Ultimately, I feel bad for the impending generations, as the author explained how we will not be affected as much in our lifetime, but those in the next century will be facing incredibly dangerous conditions. If all else fails, we must hope that we manage to cultivate life on another planet like Mars as Elon Musk and others attempt to do. Overall, I thought Well did a great job explaining the dilemma and the resulting issues that will arise, and i hope more people begin to become aware of how serious this problem is.

After reading the "Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I surprisingly felt numb to the presentation of the different types of disasters that are likely to occur through climate change because of what humans have done through the use of fossil fuels, deforestation, etc. Personally, I feel that Wallace's presentation of his article as an alarmist is fitting and does indeed invoke me to take action and many others despite the sense of impending doom that his article presents. When it comes to environmental issues and many political issues I don't think being an alarmist steers other's gaze away, on the contrary, I believe that when it comes to global issues an alarmist viewpoint is more likely to catch a viewer or readers eye. The most compelling of the list provided was 'Perpetual War' because it questions what governments are willing to do and how humans may still have more motivation to go to war for resources than to come together, a constant fight to take someone else's dues. For example, when Wallace states that for every half-degree societies would see a 10-20 percent increase in armed conflict it adds perspective on how these governments won't just be going against other societies but in many cases will find trouble within their own. Overall, this article definitely added more urgency into the way I see my day to day and how the greed of a few can affect the many.

Reading "the uninhabitable earth” is one of the most educational articles I have read on climate change. Before reading this article, I was aware of the science behind climate change but I was unaware of the speed at which it is happening. This article opened my eyes to the terrifying reality we will soon face if we don’t drastically cut down our use of fossil fuels soon. Before educating myself on the consequences of climate change, I would have considered Wallace-Wells an alarmist, however after reading the first section “Doomsday” I realize how imminent these consequences our to our planet so I would no longer consider him an alarmist. I understand his drastic perspective, people need to be educated on this topic if they are to change their lifestyles and reduce their carbon footprint. We need more authors like Wallace-Wells to force people to face the realities of climate change, for decades scientist have known about climate change but until very recently world leaders have not done much to address the situation. Wallace-Wells does bring attention to this topic in an alarming way, however he is not exaggerating the danger, he is just stating the reality of the current situation. Soon many places on earth will become too hot to be habitable, water vapor in the air will reach temperatures that could burn people’s skin, crops will not grow and natural disasters will become more frequent. Although all these facts seen extreme and unlikely, they are already starting to happen and people need to start worrying about climate change because it will likely affect their lives in the near future.

“The Unihabital Earth” by David Wallace-Wells put me in a bad mood to say the lease. I’ve already been informed on most of the different effect that the climate crisis has and could possibly cause so the content. In the article isn’t necessarily what ticked me off. Reading the article was a reminder that the climate crisis has been known about for a long time and our leaders haven’t done anything to significantly solve the problem. In our current day, the sitting president of the the United States is a climate denier who says that the climate crisis is a hoax. A large portion of our state legislatures side with the president or are massively misinformed. We live in an era where we have a scientifically illiterate adult population and unfortunately these adult run the country. Real boomer energy. We could wait for generational change in our government but we don’t have a generations worth of time to clean up the planet. The effects of climate change shown in this articles do make me anxious but it’s also a call to action for me. I’ll be living on this rock for little while so might as well keep it hospitable for everything on it.

Reading the article makes me feel pessimistic about our future, especially when considering how every aspect of human life is deeply influenced by climate change:Crop, one of primary source of food, drops its yielding; Forest fire has become more and more frequent and destructive. Amazon, providing 20 percent of our oxygen, will likely dry out in few years; higher temperature even leads to higher chance of crime rates and armed conflicts between countries…These consequences are bad enough, but what seems more worrisome is our attitude towards climate change. Many people are still unaware of the danger caused by climate change, while some people, even though knowing the existence and effect of climate change, would still choose ignore these issues in their daily lives as they believe the climate issue is easily controllable and those consequences mentioned in the article will never happen to them. Not even individuals, government also play an important role in preserving the earth. However, these countries from cop21 that made an agreement on controlling temperature rise will likely break their promise as the temperature will likely rise 1.5 Celsius degrees, which is enough for a profound impact. 
<br><br>
Admittedly, what is happening to our earth is frightening. But, we can make the situation look better. To the government, an agreement with strict enforcement mechanism is urgently needed. To us, it’s time to realize what is going on around us and take actions. The earth’s future is on our shoulder. It’s time to save our planet.

After reading the article "Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I was immediately in shock. His article had a lot of information that was eye opening to me and felt, in a way, quite intimidating. I can see why some people would call him an alarmist, there were points that seemed exaggerated like when he said that with more heat and global warming, would come more cussing and swearing, but other than that, I would have to say his arguments were mostly fair and were made within reason. His goal is obviously to get people to "wake up" and see what is happening to their planet in hopes to get them to make a difference, so I understand why he writes with so much concern, intensity, and passion.  I felt that his most compelling argument was the one about the spread of disease because it's already a problem that we have been experiencing more and more.  Its also the one that scares me the most, disease is so easily spreadable but not everyone has access to healthcare and can get the treatment they need if they get  ill. I hope that humanity realizes the need for us to take action so that the future he describes in his article doesn't become a reality.

I completely agree with your take on the way Wallace Wells presented his case and that in relation to people viewing him as an alarmist. Unfortunately, his "alarmist" essay is just presenting facts and attempting to showcase the truth about the condition of the climate crisis. Just because the reality of the climate crisis is alarming within itself does not mean that any piece of writing about the climate crisis is an an alarmist's work.

This article presented so many various consequences of climate change that I would not have even thought to consider. I thought some of the observations he made were extremely interesting, and I have personally not read an article that focused on as many different consequences as he did. I feel as though many articles highlighting the consequences of climate change focus heavily on its effects in terms of CO2 levels and dangers to the ocean, which are extremely important to understand, but leave out other considerations like its effects on conflict, disease, human cognition and economic growth. I found it a particularly surprising to learn how climate change could potentially play a role in the conflict and war, and am actually quite surprised that I have not read any articles about this in particular in mainstream media. Or the fact that diseased trapped in ice caps are bound to make a comeback. It was also extremely alarming to learn that the European heat wave in 2003 led to the death of 2,000 people a day! And that was seventeen years ago! This provoked such a sense of worry in me, as it gave me a major wake up call in terms of realizing that I’ve only been scratching the surface in terms of climate-change related issues. 
 <br><br>
Personally, I don’t believe that Wallace-wells is an alarmist. All the concerns that he raises, I believe are valid. But at the same time it confuses me a little to see that being an  “alarmist” has such a negative connotation. Honestly, humanity has been ignoring the effects of climate change for many years now, so it seems that taking an alarmist approach is the only way people will listen. It’s unfair for people to present people like Wallace-wells as an exaggerator, when his projections are not absurd as people claim they are. Without alarmists, it’s less likely that people will understand how pressing of an issue this is. However, I can understand why some people may view this as being counterproductive. For instance, after reading the article, as much as I would have hoped that it prompted immediate action from me, my first reaction was the opposite. It was extremely overwhelming to the point where it made me feel really small and insignificant in solving the problem, even though that is not the case. 
 <br><br>
I also think that the quote, “you got to watch that you don’t say the giant problem shouldn’t be solved because the solution causes some smaller problems,” by Wally Broecker is extremely important. I have talked to a countless number of people that have this mindset, and I truly believe that this will not get us anywhere in at least attempting to make things better. It also really reminds me of the “if we can’t solve the whole problem immediately, we shouldn’t even try” attitude, and how disruptive and how regressive this can be in humanity’s attempt to initiate change, and that we should never stop trying.

I found this article to be incredibly interesting and I thought that it did an amazing job at describing just how dire the consequences of climate change are. I have never before read an article or watched a video that has presented all of the different effects of climate change in such a clear way. Normally when we learn about climate change, we only hear about a few of these consequences, such as rising sea levels, however this article goes much farther by listing several consequences of climate change, which emphasizes just how bad it is. David Wallace-Wells is definitely not an alarmist in this article. Wallace-Wells' concerns are completely valid and relevant and his concerns should not be seen as a bad quality or lessen his credibility at all. He has every reason to be alarmed and, in my opinion, everyone should be more alarmed when it comes to climate change. As we can see in his article, climate change is a very serious issue that we need to be alarmed about if we are going to be able to make any sort of change. While reading this article I found myself thinking about my own lifestyle quite a bit and making mental notes about different ways that I can make a difference. However, even though this article definitely prompted me to action, it also made me feel extremely useless because I know that it will take a lot more than just me to make any significant changes. I know this thought should not, and will not, stop me from doing my best to minimize my impact on climate change, but it is still very disheartening to know that the majority of people will not do anything to alter their impact, and that many people still don't even consider climate change to be a threat. This article brought up quite a few consequences of climate change that I was not aware of. One that I found extremely alarming and interesting was that there are several diseases currently frozen, that are being exposed due to global warming. It is terrifying to think of all the horrible diseases that will exposed that have killed and harmed so many people and animals in the past. Overall I found this article to be very interesting and eye-opening, and would definitely recommend it to friends and family so that they can be more aware of the implications of climate change.

When people think about climate change sometimes they can only think of a few consequences that don’t seem relatable to them so they don’t seem to care. Rising sea water won’t affect them so why should they care? I agree with you that this article does a splendid job of stating so many consequences of climate change that doesn’t immediately come to mind like the rise of diseases (from the past and new that have adapted), increasing economic debt, riots, and more. These are more applicable and hence allow people to feel more engaged with the information presented. Although that does allow us to get caught up and somewhat overwhelmed with the situation at hand, it is comforting that there are some possible solutions proposed. But with that being said, in no way is David Wallace-Wells an alarmist in this article. He proposed many issues, concerns and potential scenarios that are valid and extreme in the right way. Obviously no one can predict exactly how severe and fast the consequences are, but what Wallace-Wells tells us is a great example of how chaotic the future could get. 
<br><br>
All of this information can be a bit overwhelming. It can make you get caught up in all the details that you lose sight of what’s important, actually making a change to better the earth and all species on it. I also think that it’s disheartening that a lot of people will not alter their impact, but it is comforting to know that most people are not denying climate change, they just don’t know and or want to live a more sustainable life. And with some education we can get there. This article was a good mix of information and imagination that allowed me to place myself in the future to see the true horror and sparked me to make more changes in my every day life!
<br><hr>

I agree that “The Uninhabitable Earth” is an eye opening article. Before taking this course, when I thought of climate change, rising sea levels was the first thing that came to mind. I think because so many people equate climate change and rising sea levels, they don’t take the issue as serious as it truly is. The two consequences that socked me the most were climate plagues and permanent economic collapse. While many people may think they won’t be affected by rising sea levels, this article puts into perspective that the entire world will be affected. It’s terrifying to think that diseases and plagues are trapped in ice because at the rate that were causing ice to melt, we may soon face some of the world’s most devastating plagues and diseases- at once… 
<br><br>
“Every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London, keep in mind, costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice.” As for economic collapse it’s ironic how many argue that we owe our economic prosperity to fossil fuels, but our use of fossil fuels will lead to the devastating economic downfall. Maybe if more people knew how climate change will affect our economy, they’d be more worried about it. I don’t think Wallace-Wells is an alarmist because even though we may think the consequences are “too extreme” or it’s just the “worst case scenario,” at the rate that we are exploiting the planet, it’s absolutely necessary for us to be worried for the future and take action. I will also definitely share this article with my friends.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I realized that I was uninformed in how climate change has been and will continue to dramatically affect the world we live on. I disagree with the claim that he is an “alarmist”. The claims made in the article are clearly outlined and backed up by scientific evidence. Many other scientists who share similar views also support the article. In order to emphasize the severity of the situation Wallace needed to outline the path of destruction that we will create if no action is taken. However, I would agree that article’s like this do risk the possibility of scaring people away and making them feel helpless to the situation. Wallace touches on this when he says “but aversion arising from fear is a form of denial”. This quote resonated with me because I also felt fear in feeling helpless to the situation. After reading this article I thought about it for sometime. The fear passed and I started to feel prompted to make changes in my own life that negatively affect the earth. Manly the amount of waste I collect by single use plastic. In the article he touches on the many ways that the earth with start to change. Including longer forest fires, air quality, ocean acidification, economic collapse, and war. Though all equally alarming, the section regarding food shortage is really compelling. I believe that if changes are not made by massive amounts of the population we will see a rise of starvation related deaths. This is compelling because the people that are dying of starvation are part of some of the poorest places in the world and contribute very little to climate change. This injustice relates to the term of Climate Justice that we learned about in class. This term highlights how what is happening to millions of people in poor countries is unethical and a political issue.

After reading the article it was surprising to know that the effects we see today are from actions from decades ago and made me realize if there is any way to even save the planet from the actions from today that might have very severe consequences in the next coming decades.  I made a note that Wells emphasizes how many scientists predict that Miami and Bangladesh will be no more almost for sure because even if we were to stop producing fossil fuels today they would still be no more within the timespan of the century.  I was also surprised when Wells mentioned that warming of two degrees was considered a catastrophe and with the factors of today that promote warming of the climate scientist have predicted that within thirteen years an increase of five degrees of warming will be present.  
<br><br>

I agree that Wells makes a good description of how the planet will be in the next coming decades, however, he did note that all of these predictions will probably not happen but some will almost definitely happen.  One change that he mentioned was the increase of fires in size and I feel like the damage of fires are already happening because in California we are getting fires in places that usually do not have fires and the places the normally have fires are starting to have fires more frequently with a bigger damage radius.  Also, Ken had mentioned that Santa Barbara was expected to have a hurricane which in California we do not have hurricanes at all but with the weather change drastically hurricanes are almost a possibility for California.

<p>
I do not, in anyway, believe that David Wallace- Wells is taking an alarmist approach to climate change. 
<br><br>
In his introduction to “The Uninhabitable Earth”, it is explicitly stated that he is not attempting to 
predict the outcome of climate change. Rather, he phrases it a "portrait of our best understanding 
of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action". In the article, Wells is assuming the worst
because that is the direction in which the earth is currently heading. The entire purpose of the article
is to raise awareness so such a future does not occur. 
<br><br>

I believe "The Uninhabitable Earth" does an exceptional job at covering many of the potential outcomes that 
may arise from our current carbon emissions. There are many instances in which he covers predictions extremely 
relevant to current events. For example, he mentions the increased amount of fires which is especially telling of the recent bush fires that have been terrorizing Australia. He also mentions the increased aggression of the Middle East due to climate change which is highlighted by recent events occurring in Iran. The fact that these things are happening all around us really puts it into perspective on how dire the situation really is.
 <br><br>

Another thing that I found interesting was the positive feedback loops that may occur as a result of climate change that people dont take into consideration. For many people, they believe there's simply _ amount of carbon emissions that occur in a given year. However, those people fail to take into account many additional factors that may contribute to the problem. For example, higher temperatures will cause more ice to melt which means less absorption which means more warming.

After reading the Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells, I feel as though I am much more knowledgable about the potential outcomes of global warming, why it is occurring and what has already happened to the Earth due to the damage we have already done. The outcomes Wallace-Wells talks about are very grim, and in my opinion can be framed by the concept of an “apocalypse” as this is genuinely what the outcomes he discusses would be like. This idea he briefly introduces stood out to me because I had never previously thought that an apocalypse was ever going to be a real threat to the Earth, instead I used to think of it more of an overdone Hollywood movie plot. After reading this article it has become clear to me that global warming will eventually be the destruction of mankind if something doesn’t end us sooner. Wallace-Wells lists arguments that are not always thought of when the words “climate change” comes to mind, which introduces these negative potential outcomes to readers. These compelling arguments delve into famine, disease and other issues that are already present in some areas of the world today but would be on a mass scale if climate change continues to exponentially get worse. 
<br><br>

 The argument that terrified me the most was the idea of plagues and other disease arising from arctic ices melting. This is so prominent to me as I have learned a lot about plague and disease that ravaged the world in history where illness took out entire powerful civilizations, and the thought that this may once again happen is unspeakable. I also was unaware that this was even possible. Economic collapse and poisoned oceans (among others) are of course just as detrimental, but something about the psychological trauma disease brings to groups of people is a different kind of horror. 
 <br><br>

 The fact that we have had several mass extinctions in the history of the Earth that wiped out nearly the entire living world makes me believe that we are recording and are aware of the mass extinction that we will have a hand in, yet many people don’t take it seriously. These arguments that Wallace-Wells states should be known to the world because maybe people would care more if they knew all of the potential risks.

Reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was a piece that not only made me fear for the death of our planet, but encouraged me to re-evaluate my footprint and the way I use up the earth's resources. The tone Wallace uses is a scary one, as he tells this grim and terrible future that our planet holds all due to our overconsumption. In detail, he describes what our world will look like filled with droughts, heat, wars, and famine. He effectively illustrates how by the end of the century, we will have backlash in our food, air, and all the things we have come to love.
<br><br>

I believe that Wallace, despite the way he presents himself, is not an alarmist. Although he tells of a dark future and amplifies his depiction, Wallace presents evidence and statistics that back up his points. I believe that his heightened emotions come from not wanting to see the world slowly decaying, and therefore needs his message to be impactful and stick with readers, just like it did with me. He uses these points to emphasize the call for action that people need to have in order to fight the possibility for this future. Fossil fuel polluting the air is already harming people all over the world, and will not cease to hurt more when the North Poles methane bomb is released into the atmosphere. 
<br><br>

As overwhelming as the article may be, it is important to take the message of cutting out fossil fuels over everything else. We need proper and practical solutions to stop our world from decaying, and we need it fast. Our world won't hold on for much longer, and it will be all our fault.

Before reading David Wallace-Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", I thought I was well-aware of the situation of our planet and about how climate change was affecting it. I thought it would address the same issues people have brought awareness to through social media, political campaigns, and protests: melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and warmer climates. However, the article proved that all of those things are just surface-level consequences of the human actions that contribute to climate change. The actual truth of what will happen is much worse than anyone anticipates and Wallace-Wells makes sure to go to the very depth of the issue in order to explain the crazy chain-reaction of events that will take place if our planet's average temperature goes up by only a couple of degrees.
<br><br>

One of the things the author mentions in his article that I had never considered was how it is scientifically proven that an increase in the average temperature of the Earth will also lead to an increase in war because of issues like agriculture, economics, and migration. This was a very interesting revelation, because it showed how much of an umbrella issue climate change is and how it is indirectly connected to a lot of the things that cause people to suffer: starvation, economical issues, and war.
<br><br>

As Ken mentions, many people think that David Wallace-Wells utilizes an alarmist approach and seems to imply that we are insanely close to passing the point of no return, that the planet is doomed, and there is no hope left. I agree that the tone is highly urgent, but I also believe that it is rightfully so. A large percentage of people still deny the existence of climate change, and there is no way to force them to acknowledge the terrors of it, but the author manages to capture the intensity of the threat in the most professional way by including evidence from scientific research. Even if not all of what he says is likely to happen, he still includes a large variety of possibilities, of which at least one should hit home for any person out there, including a climate change denier.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I felt a definite sense of impending doom.  Although the article is incredibly pessimistic, I think this tactic works as a sort of wake up call.  He does not sugar coat the issue but instead provides a very real outlook on the future of the planet if change is not made immediately.  He provides a detailed description of each of the consequences of climate change; while each is alarming on their own, taken together, it makes me feel as if the changes I make in my own life to combat this issue will make no difference in the long run.

<br><br>

Although Mr. Wells’ article is quite alarming, I would not label him as an “alarmist.”  While his article can come off as pessimistic, I think that he raises awareness for the issue without placing the responsibility to solve it on a single person.  He also points out issues that are not commonly known; at least, I had never heard of them before.  I think that he conveys the issue in a way most people do not want to hear because he simply points out what will occur if we do not act now.  This makes me feel a sense of fear coupled with the hope that we will start to move towards a sustainable way of living.

<p>
Reading the "Uninhabitable Earth" helped to open my eyes to the catastrophic consequences that the world may face if we don't collectively fight against climate change. The world is moving towards a 2-4 degree increase in global temp that will have alarming impacts on the environment and all living things. Wallace highlights nightmarish outcomes like the rise of the bubonic plague and perpetual war that I had never known about before. Personally the idea of unfightable diseases being released from melting ice caps terrifies me. Even if humanity is able to persevere through extreme weather and polluted air, disease still could easily come along and gruesomely wipe out entire populations.
<br><br>

Although Wallace uses some fear tactics in his article to strengthen its effect I do not think that he is an alarmist. Alarmists are commonly people who incite unnecessary panic through exaggeration. Wallace’s predictions however are in no way exaggerations. His points about the possible fate of the world are highly supported by scientific evidence and previous climate change events in earth's history. It's possible that Wallace risks alienating some readers who may have differing views about climate change. Even though some readers may not be as receptive to what Wallace has to say I believe the effect he achieved by laying all the dangers on the table was incredibly effective.



</p><hr>



<p>
In my opinion, Wallace Wells method of alerting to the potential dangers of the future is quite reasonable due to the fact that his information has been scientifically proven to show that this these changes caused by increases in temperature could be seen within the very near future. Even just starting off with the doomsday section in which he told us that the permafrost that encased Norway’s Svalbard seed vault had melted, this shows that even our last resorts are being impacted as this was something designed to protect our agriculture is some type of catastrophe were to occur. A line from Wallace Wells that resonated with me was “But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial, too.” There are instances in which we want to ignore the problem and in doing so we deny that climate change is even happening. 
<br><br>

Something that hit me very hard is when Wallace Wells says that “Most people talk as if MIami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving”, but as the author spoke to many other scientists, they believed that within this century they will disappear even if we discontinue the usage of fossil fuels. Reading this was a reality shock for me as I hadn’t even thought about the possibility of whole cities disappearing. Knowing that we most likely won’t be able to prevent this is something that we need to take into account and protect the other places and do all that we can to prevent this from happening to other cities. In my opinion, this article doesn’t really prevent you from taking action, but instead inspires to take everything into account and take initiative in order to do all that you can to help preserve the earth.
<br><br>

In my opinion the most compelling consequence of climate change was the climate plagues. Reading the article, I had always known that the other consequences were a possibility, but I never stopped to think about all the diseases and disease bearing bugs that have been frozen and may be released. This could cause a huge problem as there may be some things that we have never been exposed to and this could be something that could cause another mass extinction event if not controlled.

After thoroughly reading the article titled “The Uninhabitable Earth” written by David Wallace-Wells, my mind was filled with fear and anxiety as I was entirely overwhelmed by the many pieces of cruel yet factual information he laid down. He employed a very confronted tone that directly presented the scary possibilities of Earth, such as the “unbreathable air,” “the poisoned ocean” and “heat death”  if no adequate actions are taken by us human beings. There is no doubt that his words drew criticisms and controversies in depicting such a dark, gloomy and hopeless picture for the future of both our planet and our species. I would disagree with the criticism that he was very much an alarmist, who spread “exaggerated” and even “twisted” lines to evoke fear and chaos within the society since, in fact, he drew most of his arguments on evidence. Specifically, Wallace-Wells utilized detailed evidence and statistics in the current time to consolidate his predictions for the future. For example, when talking about the “heat death,” he mentioned the 2003 heatwave in Europe and its insane ability to end lives; moreover, when discussing the “poisoned ocean,” he wrote about the Skeleton Coast in Namibia and the Gulf of Mexico. These were all factual and evident truths that the Earth have witnessed, and will continue to witness if our generation chose to stand aside and watch. On the other hand, I do believe it is risky to include such a long list of negative outcomes of the Earth’s future, as it could potentially inspire a hopeless attitude within people, pessimistically think that doomsday is almost inevitable and that there is nothing they can do. However, it is noteworthy that Wallace-Wells did clearly pinpointed that the power of making changes is still in our hands if we started to take actions now.
<br><br>


When putting down this article, I was compelled to be ready to contribute my effort into this larger cause. Although Wallace-Wells stressed the importance of making changes, I wasn’t so sure about what specific steps I could do. It’s too overwhelming to think of those dark consequences that the one single contribution by an individual seems to be a very small scale. However, this article definitely prompted me to take action, as now every one of us is well aware that just sitting here and doing nothing will only push the Earth, our habitat, to an unimaginably gloomy future.

Before reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I would have to say that I was completely uninformed regarding the realities of climate change. My beliefs prior to reading were that: the existence of Climate Change is debatable, and if it exists then it probably isn't an urgent issue, and would be very little a single person could do to dramatically impact the climate, negatively or positively. I found this article extremely interesting because of how Wallace-Wells breaks down how we our ultimately destroying our planet one section at a time, from sea level rising causing flooding, being unable to grow food from excess heating, the possibility of disease outbreak,  air quality being so bad it literally kills you (I was completely shocked to hear that this was responsible for 1/3 deaths in China in 2013. Wow.) Followed by increased war from economic and agricultural collapse, poisoned oceans, and ultimately the demise of our planet as we know it.
<br><br>


After reading the article, I became very concerned about the state of our planet, and if it weren't for the so-called "alarmist" way he delivers his argument, I don't think I would have been impacted in nearly the same way. Although somewhat unrelated, I have been considering a Vegan diet for health/morality purposes, but after learning truly the extent of the damage humans are causing the planet in the article, and learning in lecture/reading that a plant-based/non-imported diet can be one of the best actions, if not the best action a single human can take to help the environment, I decided I am going to switch to an all plant-based diet. Although the article was very good at pointing out everything human's were doing to cause climate change and the extent of the damage this climate change will cause the earth, I would like to be further educated on what we can do not only to prevent further damage, but reverse some of what is already done.

David Wallace-Wells has a reputation of being an alarmist, but I don’t think his alarms are unjustified. He does take an aggressive approach to narrating the facts he presents, but I think it’s necessary for people like me who knew only a little bit about climate change and its repercussion- I didn’t fully understand the extent of what would happen. 2 degrees Celsius seems like such a small increase when I first read about it, but the impact is drastic because even ½ a degree Celsius increase can do massive damage. When Wells said “Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe…. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate accords and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it.” 
<br><br>

This was the statement that really hit home for me because it highlighted the importance of taking action now. It’s more than just rising sea levels, but an entire host of problems that may follow as well. I had no idea that we faced risks like unleashing contained diseases because so much of what I’ve read about the climate crisis centered around rising sea levels. This entire article was essentially my introduction to the climate crisis and it was so necessary.

As someone who already believes in Climate Change and thought I knew exactly what our lack of action on the subject would cause, the severity of the consequences laid out by Wallace shocked me. After reading about the various consequences in “The Uninhabitable Earth”, such as potential plagues, end of food and even a mass extinction caused by heat death, I believe David Wallace is not an alarmist. His position of urgency is definitely valid. My overall feelings about the article is that it is a good call to action for those who already believe in climate change. However, I fear those in denial will feel bombarded with information that they feel is meant to scare them into believing. For those in denial, big statistics coupled with a sense of urgency may never persuade them because people are often stubborn and set on their opinions. In terms of the different harmful outcomes Wallace discussed, I found the topic of war to be most interesting. If we as humans work together towards a cause, we can achieve almost anything. In my belief this includes solving climate change, even if we wait to the point of irreversible damage. However, if the effects of climate change turn people against each other and create war, I genuinely fear we will wipe ourselves out. According to the article, research points to a 10-20% increase in the chance of violent conflict for every half degree celsius the globe warms. The science concludes that social conflict could have the potential to double within this century. I think that the disaster, panic and scarcity of resources caused by other consequences of climate change have a real chance of creating war. So to me, my biggest concern is that we will act too late to solve the issues of climate change and resort to fighting each other instead of the crisis itself.

When I was reading the article “The Unattainable Earth” I was reminded about the oceanography course I took last year. The article mentions the ph level in the ocean is going down making the water more acidic which puts ocean life at risk. With this being said the amount of seafood that will be available to the people will drop putting many at starvation. The rise in ocean temperature will rise the sea level drowning all the cities on the coast. 
<br><br>
As stated in your video it is nearly impossible to stop the rise of temperature at 2 ºC. The Temperature is going to rise and we can't do anything to completely stop it but we can slow down the rise in temperature. The world may not end if the temperature continues to rise but the era of human life may end and that is what scares people. There have been 5 previous mass extinctions and this may be the 6th one that will occur and that is completely fine because it is part of the cycle. The main question to answer is, are we trying to slow down the temperature rise truly because we want to help the earth or because we are scared that the human race is coming to an end?

In “The uninhabitable Earth”, the author David Wallace-Wells makes his point that environmental disasters are definitely happening and will worsen if no action is taken on this problem. He listed nine ways in which the Earth will become uninhabitable: doomsday, heat death, the end of food, climate plagues, unbreathable air, perpetual war, permanent economic collapse, poisoned oceans and the great filter. An alarmist is someone who is considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic. Wallace-Wells is absolutely not an alarmist since
<br><br>
all of his arguments are supported by interviews, exchanges with climatologist and researchers in the related field and are based on many research papers. He is using facts to state the possible future if humanity does not at some point wake up and act. I think this is the perfect way to address an issue as urgent and climate change.
<br><br>
“The uninhabitable Earth” is a wakeup call for me and I definitely feel prompted to action and do whatever I can to contribute to the effort of saving out planet from becoming inhabitable.

<p>
Although Wallace Wells attempted to alarm his readers with the information provided in his article, he seemed to have gone slightly overboard by implementing the use of a quite hopeless and matter-of-fact tone. Speaking as if all of these disastrous events will happen even though they may not, and leaving out information about what humans needs to start doing to counteract such events did make me feel quite at a loss. I have tried my very best to reduce my carbon footprint by eating a mostly plant based diet, reducing my use of single-use plastic items, recycling and repurposing for most of my adolescent life. This article made me feel like it does not matter what I do to try and help, because ultimately very drastic changes to law and environmental policy seems to be our only chance.
<br><br>

I do agree that Wallace Wells’s alarmist nature may cause many people to dismiss his words and give up hope completely. I think this is largely due to the fact that a lot of people are selfish and realize that these drastic climate changes may not ever affect them in their lifetime, so why should they put any of their energy into making a change? I certainly felt this feeling for a brief period after reading that article, but soon became compelled to not succumb to such a defeated attitude. If everyone were to not care, the terrifying outcomes Wallace Wells outlines may come true. One of these outcomes that I had never considered but truly see happening is ongoing war. Tensions will rise as our planet becomes depleted of food, water, and fertile land and may very easily force us into another world war. We can no longer remain inactive as a species and must figure out a way to prevent our own extinction instead of bring it on more rapidly.

Reading the "Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells ties into themes of worry about the impending doom that is climate change that I have heard my entire life. He makes precise points about many alternate ways of how climate change will hurt our environment, providing details of how the changes will occur and their connections to other ecosystems on Earth. The article did not exactly make me spring into action, but rather be more conscious of the factors in my life that can contribute to climate change. I definitely believe that taking an alarmist approach to climate change can alienate people because taking in all this mortifying information all at once, especially with the details being well supported, because people will chose not to believe what they are reading so they do not go outside of their knowledge comfort zone. The most compelling of worries was the ocean acidification because of the chain of events that will be connected to it. This is because of how heavy of a reliance that food is gotten from their as well as the habitats that will be destroyed and unable to be brought back, creating problems that cannot be fixed even when the people of Earth finally ready to combat it. The biggest thing that is sitting inside of me after reading this article is the feeling of pessimism I have a hard time thinking that world leaders will take action due to their wants of personal gains in life that come from not combating climate change. If we have all this overwhelming evidence not just now but from the past few decades, why not make a spring to action that will allow us to coexist with all other beings and environments on Earth?

Before reading "Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells, I was expecting a dry article with statistics related to the climate crisis. The climate crisis has never really interested me, until reading this article. This article provided viewpoints from many different climatologists and explored the consequences of our Earth warming. I learned that there are many different possible consequences if we do not take action soon, including poisoned oceans, economic collapse, and unbreathable air. David Wallace Wells could be classified as an alarmist, however I feel he does not come off as aggressive or excessive. He does a good job of bringing attention to what will happen if we do not take action, without scaring the audience too much to the point where they stop reading. The topic of heat death was interesting to read because he explains how our body temperatures will not be able to adjust with extreme rises and/or drops in temperature. I also found it interesting that only a 1.5 rise in temperature will likely result in catastrophic consequences. All in all, this was an informative article and definitely a wake up call to those who are unaware of our Earth its future.

According to Dave Wells, in his article "Uninhabitable Earth" even when we train our eyes on climate change, we will never really fully comprehend it's scope. Wells intricately broke down this notion by exposing the alarming ways climate change can devastate our current geological state. I was alarmed by the amount of data and statistical predictions present in this article.  And with that, I felt the dire threat of climate change, that according to Wells, was missing from the scientific data that "conscientious" scientists have been communicating to the masses. Wells devised "Doomsday" as an article that diverged from the sub-culture of "scientific reticence" he is protesting against. 
  <br><br>
We should be alarmed. Especially when our society is ruled by technocrats who believe any problem can be solved. Donald Trump, for example, President of the most influential and watched country in the world, announced that the U.S. would cease all participation in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation. As one of the leading sources of emissions, only second to China, the United States is inciting a culture that sees climate change as unworthy to address. Intergovernmental coordination is crucial in solving a problem as difficult as climate change. The United States administration led by Donald Trump turned a blind-eye on years of research on the severe consequences of burning fossil fuels. The industrial civilization that we've built is going to be capped by environmental retaliation. Reducing the rates of our fossil fuel use is not enough to stop losing Miami and Bangladesh from rising sea levels, according to the article. This doesn't even scratch the surface of the different ways that global warming is going to shake our societies and ecosystems. Thawing of permafrost in the Arctic, heatwaves and extreme drought in Europe, the tropics, and Middle-East, restoration of prehistoric plagues and diseases, unbreathable air, and poisoned oceans. These are only some of the examples of the destruction that is to come. We should be more alarmed, and become alarmists ourselves. We can communicate and emphasize the gravity of this issue. We should be optimistic like Dave Wells and think that we can solve this issue regardless of the difficulty because we have no choice but to. Aversion is not a choice that will be there forever when encountered by fear of a difficult problem, soon we will be forced to face the consequences of our perpetuated denial of climate change.

After reading David Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth” I became more alarmed about the climate change situation. With the article going in detail at how climate change will affect not just our generation’s lives but also future ones in a great way makes this seem like a grave situation that we must pay attention to. Before taking this course I was among those who believed in climate change occurring, but unaware at how severe it actually was in reality. It is definitely something that this article by Wallace concerned me in many ways. Primarily I was amazed at how Wallace described many different scenarios in which we will all be severely affected by climate change. It honestly brings fear to think about a summer with extreme heats even worse than the ones I’ve experienced thus far. It is also concerning to think about all these possible diseases that can spread with the melting of Arctic ice; ones which we will be unaware of and possibly not have cures for. It is unnerving to think about all these scenarios in our near future all because of our man made decisions. Wallace does a great job here in his article in making the situation alarming and it causes the reader to feel guilty in helping to contribute to this. He uses these disasters that’ll be caused by climate change to educate us about the situation and open our eyes that it isn’t too late yet to take action.

It is surprising to know that even the slightest rise in the global temperature would impact on the planet profoundly because the influence lasts longer than it seems. After reading the article, I don’t find Wallace-Wells being to alarmist at this question. We should always be aware of the climate and at what rate it changes. The point of him laying out the worst outcome when people is not helping is try to raise awareness instead of fear. Awareness allows people to act immediately and wisely before it’s too late, but fear incapacitate people. I feel prompted to action because we still have time to take it.
  <br><br>

I feel like the unbreathable air would be the worst to imagine or to live with among all the possibilities. I feel this way because I have experienced breathing relatively unclean air, and I know how that affects the human body. There was a time during which the air quality was pretty worrisome in my hometown, but it seemed like it had changed nothing even though so much effort was put in. People got serious breathing issues, and the unclean air resulted in many diseases. Sometimes all kinds of outdoor activities were canceled because of the bad air quality. We suffered from that and are unwilling to see it getting worse.

<p>
The article “Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace Wells confirmed my darkest fears on the inevitable consequences of climate change. Not only did the article address the address the idea of human extinction, but it presented nine scenarios that could (will) play out if humanity continues to abuse the environment as we do. Of these nine scenarios, two especially stood out to me. The idea of unbreathable air and heat death have created a mental image in thoughts of what earth will be in the event of a massive warming and global suffocation. I had no idea that in 2003, a European was killing nearly 2000 people per day, I can only imagine what these number will look like as time progresses and we continue to ignore climate change. The article also brings up the role of air conditioning in an extremely hot climate. Though air conditioning may look like the solution to escaping the heat,   the machines introduce a number of carbon problems. Additionally, many of the hottest parts of the world suffer from extreme poverty making it financially impossible for individuals to purchase these machines which may save their life. 

  <br><br>

Furthermore, the idea of unbreathable air is what I fear the most, mainly because of the cognitive effects that come with it. As air quality decreases, so does human cognitive ability and the chance for birth defects. This article introduced me to the correlation between polluted air and the higher chance of autism that comes with it. It is scary to think that the air we breathe will make us cognitively slower which will hinder the future generations thinking ability eventually turning us into a primitive species. Along with the cognitive effects, other health risks just as detrimental come with poorer air quality such as respiratory and heart problems. Not only will our bodies slowly regress but our brains and thinking power will too, humanity will just keep getting weaker and weaker until earth gets too hot and we slowly melt into the pavement we laid over the plant life that gave us the opportunity to breathe in the first place.  
  <br><br>
That is my nightmare.

<p>
After I've done the reading "Uninhabitable Earth" written by David Wallace Wells, I would believe that he is absolutely an alarmist.This is because that he starts of his article by stating a myriad of possible outcomes of rising global temperature, such as rising in sea level, more frequent hurricanes and disasters, poles are getting warmer and hence the sea ice are melting rapidly, which cause the ability of reflecting sunlight dropping, leading to further rise in global temperature. He keeps alarming the readers by telling that this is actually happening, and if we don't take serious actions to slow the rate of rising temperature, these will only getting worse. Paris Agreement includes many nations in pursuing to limit the temperature rise to just 1.5 degree Celsius. However, recently, the United States, the country which emits second most of greenhouse gases, has left this organization. This will cause other countries in Paris Agreement do less effort in pursuing this goal. 
  <br><br>

By reading this article, I have a deep sympathy towards what Wallace Wells said. My hometown, which is located in Changsha, China, is getting much hotter and hotter these years. When I was still in elementary school in Changsha, the temperature in Changsha in summer was just relaxing and little bit sense of hot. However, when I visit Changsha these years, I can personally feel how evidently the temperature has been risen these years. When it comes to summer, the air becomes hard to breathe, and walking under the sun for just a minute will drench people's clothes, not to mention that doing sport will cause black out. When it becomes more severe, the temperature may even rise up tp 43 degree Celsius, which is hard to imagine the life people might live under this condition, and the most important fact is that it's just 2019, if we do not take action right now, what will my hometown be? An truly Uninhabitable place.

The article “Inhabitable Earth” By David Wallace-Wells appears, at first glance, to be a climate change alarmist’s radical thoughts on how detrimental climate change has become for the health of our planet. However, the more I kept on reading the article, the more my eyes were opened to how many real-world consequences global warming will have on future generations. Wells simply takes on a very serious tone as he lays out some facts he strongly believes are true concerning the alarming changes our world is going through with global warming as a result of fossil fuels. With the PPM of Carbon Dioxide quickly rising, our atmosphere is getting more acidic and trapping more greenhouse gases. This, in turn, makes our oceans more acidic, killing wildlife that cannot keep up with the ocean’s changing chemistry. Meanwhile, global temperatures are steadily rising every day. It amazes me how much damage we have committed toward our planet to make it “Inhabitable” as Wells suggests. For instance, global temperatures have risen an average of 1.5 degrees celsius and only a two-degree temperature rise is enough to destroy the base income source of food for people who live on the coast (people in countries such as Bangladesh) due to ocean levels rising. In other words, people living close to the coast will have to move out to avoid their homes from being flooded. Besides, as we learned in class, half of the world’s coral reefs have died within the last 30 years. Since coral reefs are a great habitat for many marine species, their gradual path to extinction also signifies the death of other creatures who rely on coral to survive. With fewer marine animals in the coastal regions of the ocean, people who live close to the ocean no longer have access to a steady source of food.

  <br><br>


Another huge issue that the article talks about is establishing a link between the recent natural disasters that have been occurring all over the world and climate change. For instance, I found a very interesting and obvious correlation between the article’s warnings and the Australian wildfires that are occurring. Wells points out that the Californian fire season is now longer than 78 days than it was before. He argues that especially with wildfires, loads of Carbon Dioxide gets released into the atmosphere which warms up the planet and contributes to a drier climate where more wildfires can occur. In Australia, this process can be seen in its entirety. There are hundreds of millions of plants burning up, releasing tons of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. The fires are difficult to put out because the climate has become dry which is a very favorable environment for fire to grow in. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Wells also brings attention to hurricanes that are also appearing to grow stronger with the effects of global warming. Wells mentions that we’re going to have to find new categories to describe them because they are getting much stronger than before. As hurricanes form in warm waters, it’s no wonder we’re seeing more of them with global warming. In 2019, Hurricane Barry and Hurricane Dorian cost the U.S. 600 million and 4.6 billion dollars respectively (A Review of the Atlantic Hurricane Season of 2019, Jeff Masters). Hurricane Dorian was a category 5 hurricane that reached winds up to 185 mph. This marked the fourth consecutive year that a category 5 hurricane was created.


  <br><br>

After putting down the article what I most wanted to do was understand how I could reduce my carbon footprint as a person. I believe that learning about why climate change is affecting humanity so drastically is important but even more so is understanding what everyone can do on an individual basis to contribute toward this problem. One big problem of this generation is that we are so engrossed in our own personal lives that it is hard for us to face the reality of the temperature changes and animal extinctions going on all around us. At the end of the day, we love raising awareness but also love not actively doing anything to prevent climate change from rising to exponential levels of toxicity because burning fossil fuels has become so ingrained in our lives. As such, I wished that Wells had talked more about taking individual action to help reduce carbon emissions so that everyone has a solid understanding of what they can do to contribute.

After reading “The uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, the alarmist tone began to seep in as examples of horrifying catastrophes were outlined by the climate changing. These potential incidents are outlined by Wells in accordance to the overall temperature and sea level rising around the globe. The tone of Wells did begin to make me feel anxious and made me take more of a fearful stance in the whole climate debate, I’m sure this is his tactic for his readers to instigate activity through fear or  rush action. Wells illustrates the disasters which could occur if we continue to emit enough emissions out, such as the disappearance of the city of Miami and other popular coastal cities as sea levels continue to rise. 
  <br><br>

Wells elaborates on how the rising temperatures on earth can make hurricanes more vicious in their wake of destruction. These hurricanes, both larger and stronger, can rip through cities, evoking my fears further as many of my loved ones live on coastal cities. I believe that this reading does a great job in helping me reflect on the current situation of our society and how great this change in temperature can make. The most interesting part of the reading was hearing about the five mass extinctions that have occurred throughout the earth's existence. This made me think critically on how we are just another animal on this earth who has adapted to its environment just as other animals have, we are changing the world and can greatly cause our own extinction. 
  <br><br>

In our current time, we need the perspective and rhetoric of an alarmist to help us wake up in moments in which forget our current situation. I take in Wells readings as an alarmist wake up call that everyone needs at least once in their life so that they can be aware of the potential catastrophe. Wells illustrates our current situation in an alarmist tone to help society respond to the change of climate, to help a society come together to make a real impact against our undeniable future.

After reading the "Uninhabitable Earth" I was astonished by the fact that massive heat due to the release of huge amounts of CO2 by human actions can fatally kill hundreds of people. Places like Europe, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf where the heat index once reached temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit can become very dangerous summers for people to live in. Everyday tasks are limited due to high temperatures, but what happens to people who work in fields or labor works? These people are in high dangers of many fatal health problems due to the heat but can't avoid working because they need to provide for their families. Also if you use AC to cool down that would only add to the carbon problem. The unfortunate thing is that lower-class people may not have the resources for air conditioning which leaves them with the problem of having to suffer through the summers and consequently more susceptible to harmful health issues that can lead to their death. Therefore, the scales are not equal, the wealthy are releasing more CO2 than the lower class because of their certain lifestyles and not only making the climate crisis worse for those who lack the resources but also for themselves.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells dives into the inevitable effects of global climate change. David makes the reader understand right from the start that rising sea-levels are not our only concern as the human race. He informs us that “fleeing the coastline will not be enough”. I was unaware that the permafrost in the Arctic contained “1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in Earth’s atmosphere”. This was astounding to read because the permafrost has slowly begun to melt. Which will, in fact, begin to release all of that carbon into the atmosphere and some of which will turn into methane which is one of the most dangerous greenhouse gases. This crisis is being caused by humans and has been building up for centuries. The uncontrolled use and burning of fossil fuels has caused our planet to warm drastically and is expected to become as high as eight degrees warmer. It was scary to read that more than half of the world’s population would literally be cooked to death at 11 or 12 degrees of warming. This won’t just affect us as humans, but also every other form of life on earth. Millions and millions of animals and plant species will perish in another mass extinction. He also brings up possible future plagues. This is because new forms of bacteria are being released from the melting permafrost. This can cause catastrophic effects on the human race if not controlled quickly. 
  <br><br>
Wallace-Wells brings forth the issues that we must solve quickly regarding the climate crisis. I found the “poisoned oceans” topic the hardest to take in. It made me very emotional to know that we are the reason that millions upon millions of sea creatures and plants will perish at the work of our hands. Wallace-Wells uses many different facts and scientific evidence and research to support his claims. He immediately tries to get his readers to become informed and ready to take action. After reading this article I felt very overwhelmed when it comes to solving this global crisis. I feel like many people who read this article, denier or believer, felt that it was too late and was only a matter of time. However, the main goal was to get the readers informed and learn how to take action in order to prevent the earth from further destruction. All in all, the article made me scared for our future and really brought to my eyes the dangers I am facing, especially as a young college student that will eventually be living in this “Doomsday”. On the contrary, it was relieving to hear from optimistic scientists that it wasn’t too late to save the planet and prevent a human society collapse.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” author David Wallace-Wells makes many compelling points on where the Earth is unfortunately headed. Rather than scraping the surface of the more well known consequences of climate change (sea levels rising, warming climate), he digs deeper and reveals what these changes will cause in our daily lives. This includes death by heat (dehydration leading to chronic kidney disease), inability to feed the population, ancient plagues arising from the melting permafrost, economic downfall, and much more. All of these issues are very serious, yet are not considered a priority since it has not occurred yet. 
  <br><br>

Some may believe in climate change to be in fact real, however still consider his points to exaggerated and believe he is taking an alarmist viewpoint. However, I must disagree as he has provided many sources to his points and there is much evidence of mass extinctions happening in the past due to carbon emissions, similar to what we are dealing with today but at a much faster rate. Therefore, I believe that we should all be concerned for the Earth, as everything is a cycle, and even if one minuscule part is affected, the entire chain can fall apart and cause disastrous consequences for humanity as well. Regardless if the issue at hand is being exaggerated or not, it is better to be safe than sorry in my opinion.

David Wallace's "Uninhabitable Earth" presents a variety of well thought out and constructed concepts as to how the world would become if we do not act quickly and aggressively. I would not go as far as to consider Wallace as an alarmist because he mentions consequences that are reasonably likely to take place in the near future. While he does state some predictions that I have not heard of before and admittedly initially seemed a bit far-stretched, he provides very reasonable and persuading explanations and reasoning to back up his arguments. Though I find it very likely that humanity as a whole will ultimately open our eyes and realize just how much we have damaged our home, Wallace's predictions give a sense of urgency that humanity needs to experience by providing gloomy, terrifying, and likely examples; just what we need to kick start our journey to save our planet. 

  <br><br>

Perhaps the most frightening prediction that Wallace provides in his article is "perpetual war." If climate change itself won't be the main cause of humanity's road to extinction, leave it to humanity to kill off our very own species. I had no idea that a relationship between climate change and warfare existed, and because of this very fact it is why I believe Wallace's article is a great wake up call and is by no means the writing of an alarmist.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, by David Wallace-Wells, he as an alarmist uses an very aggressive way to emphasize the issues of global warming. Wallace-Wells lists many problems if the climate change goes on. I am very impressed when I saw those facts. I draw a close attention to the unbreathable earth and end of food. Human can''t live without food or air. That means human will disappear. The other species that rely on those natural resources will extinct, too. I can sometimes see the articles or TV shows that relate to the climate change. Those information alarm me that pores will have no ice in the future and the polar bears will extinct. Global warming is a very serious problem right now. Wallace-Wells as an alarmist stands up and gives a strong proposal to the public that we need to consider how the world will be with the continuing climate crisis and take serious actions to stop it. Wallace warns the public about the damage on the ecosystem and encourage the need for control the releasing carbon dioxide. The article " The Uninhabitable Earth" even make me think about how to solve these problems. I believe that the public will aware of the issues and small power will add up to a big one. Everyone will pay attention to the environmental problem in the end.

<p>
I feel that the article entitled “The Uninhabitable Earth” written by David Wallace-Wells is a good starting point for people to learn of the consequences of human generated climate change. While the article carries a tone of hopelessness and that the vast majority of life on Earth more than likely will not survive these scenarios, I believe that an article such as this one is necessary. This article showcases some of the “worst-case scenarios” that can happen if people do not take action against this issue so perhaps this was the only kind of article that Wells could use to get his point across.
  <br><br>

I also feel that Wells created more credibility for himself and the information he gave because he released an annotated version of his article. This version shows where he had received the information he spoke about just generally highlights the parts of the article that he believes are the most important parts. I believe that this also establishes credibility for Wells himself because he realized his error for how he gave the information and tried to reconcile for it.
  <br><br>

I believe that the article is a good starting article with an important meaning, however I feel that Wells may have went a little overboard on the tone of his article. The information and scenarios he gave seemed to make it appear like there is no solution to the said issues and that nothing can be done to stop said outcomes. This form of writing may have been his intention because I believe he wanted to invoke a sense of urgency. While using fear can be a good catalyst to get people to take action, it can also lead to some unintended consequences. One such consequence being that perhaps someone will read the article and then instead of just trying to spread awareness they will get a sense of hopelessness and become despondent. So then the message that Wells is trying to get across may be missed. While this scenario may not happen it is still a possible consequence of spreading information of this nature in a way that may invoke fear.

I fundamentally disagree with the statement  "I feel that Wells may have went a little overboard on the tone of his article. The information and scenarios he gave seemed to make it appear like there is no solution to the said issues and that nothing can be done to stop said outcomes." Well-Wallace is not implying there are no solution rather that we must act with proactive urgency rather than tip toeing around issue (aversion) is not key. The fears we have about the global destruction our disgusting mentality of consumerism and hoarding created will not stop the real life threatening consequences to affect us (our most vulnerable Black and Brown folks worldwide now) and the generations to come.

In “The  Uninhabitable Earth”, the author listed many catastrophic consequences of global warming—namely, hyperthermia, reduction of crop, spread of buried diseases, toxic air, arising social conflicts, economic degeneration, and dead zones in oceans. Any single one of these consequences would be enough to subvert our “anthropocene” era. Though might not be accurate because of scientific and technological constraints, such predictions are still sufficient to show the apocalyptic future if we continue to heat our planet through burning fossil fuels. If we want to reverse all the mistakes we have made, just reducing our carbon emission would not be enough. However, we needs not to be too passive about the problem since we still have our chance to fix it. For example, we could invent an carbon-extracting mechanism to clear out carbon dioxide that our older generations have put into the atmosphere. Indeed, it would require heavy cost for theoretical progression and development of related technology, but even climatologists are optimistic that we humans can eventually solve the problem in a nice and clean manner, because of nothing but that fact that we have to, and we must. They have faith on our future, and so should we as ordinary people. We might not be able to participate in those researches directly, but what we can do is to inform more people of the climate crisis and together try our best to first reduce our carbon emission and buy more time for experts to eventually come up with the ultimate technology of salvation.

Reading “The Unhabitable Earth” by David Wallace Wells and watching Professor Hiltner’s short video provided great and alarming insight on the climate crisis. Wells pointed out early on that temperatures are rising, as well as sea levels. The more I read the article, the more my anxiety about the future of our planet grew. Wells noted that some scientists say Miami and Bangladesh will be gone within the century, and the reason for this is because of rising sea levels. Also, CO2 emissions are rising, which is causing the water to become warmer, providing more energy for hurricanes and tornadoes, which can wipe out places like Miami and Bangladesh. Experts have considered adding another category to measure the strength of these new stronger hurricanes. 

  <br><br>

Wells mentioned that the planet has faced five mass extinctions, and he believes we are currently in our sixth mass extinction. The most memorable mass extinction occurred 252 million years ago and 97% of all life on Earth died. Hopefully nothing similar occurs, but with how things are progressing, I wouldn’t rule it out. Wells said in his article that, “At 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half the world’s population, as distributed today, would die of direct heat.” This is alarming information and if this isn’t enough to stop fossil fuel companies from digging for more fossil fuels, then I don’t know what is. According to Wells, it’s almost a guarentee that the planet’s temperatures will increase by five degrees, and this is worrisome because the population will continue to grow during a dangerous time. 

  <br><br>

Wells also points out that CO2 emissions “just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100. At that concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent.” I really do not want to imagine living on a planet that has 1,000 ppm levels, but I can imagine that it would be similar to living in Hell. At that point, many people would be suffering and much of the animal populations would be dead. I’m not too optimistic about the future of our planet, but I will attempt to do everything I can to help preserve what we have left.

I can see why David Wallace Wells falls under the category for an alarmist. Truth be told, I would not have classified him as such if Kenneth hadn’t said so. An alarmist is considered someone who exaggerates a danger and so causes needless worry or panic. You would think that Wells is describing fictitious scenarios, all full of destruction, that are nowhere near us, but sadly, they are our present. So, from my point of view, Wallace is not an alarmist and I will try to tell you why I think that. Also, Wallace explains why he is writing in such an aggressive and fearful manner. He wants to spread the reality of our situation with scenarios that are now meant to be our schedule. He does not list a series of predictions but rather presents different catastrophic alternatives that may or may not happen if we fail to act. Ultimately, human response to the climate crisis will determine which stage we will leave the earth to our children and grandchildren.
     <br><br>
      My earliest memory of climate change was when I was around ten or eleven years old. At that time, we were taught that our future would not be as great as we would expect because of the way we are contaminating the world. I always thought that this issue would get fixed eventually because a solution was easily accessible, but I was wrong. I believe this was a mechanism to block the fear I felt whenever climate change was talked about. Why am I saying this? I am saying this because when I finished reading the article I was impregnated with fear. I felt somehow depressed and scared. There was so much I did not know about the consequences of climate change that he laid out nicely in nine chapters. It would seem that each chapter was worse than the previous one and in some cases it was true. The fear I felt however, was not about my future but rather the future of my children and their children. They are the ones who will inherit our earth. This warranted fear was able to make me more conscious about the destruction we are bringing upon the earth. In a way, the article has definitely encouraged me to do something about this crisis. However, while this article encourages me to act and do something about the problem, I am clueless about where to start or how to start.
    <br><br>
       As I was reading the article, there was one specific chapter that I found to be the most compelling of his argument: Climate Plagues (CH 4).
  <br><br>
Climate plagues was something I was unaware of. To think that the Arctic ice contains ancient diseases that have been trapped over the course of millions of years is just hard to believe. If such diseases were to escape, millions would die due to the lack of antibiotics that had not been developed. Before, I thought that the decrease of ice would only bring floods yet that’s not the case. It does bring floods, but also diseases, more global warming, and methane gas emissions. The melting of ice will release methane gas into the atmosphere one molecule of which equals approximately 23 molecules of carbon dioxide. Due to the positive feedback cycle instigated by the melting of the ice revealing a darker surface that increases absorption.The poles will now act as heaters instead of solar deflectors.
       <br><br>
    David Wallace Wells might be defined as an alarmist but not for me. He does a great job exposing the dangers that await us in a future where we don’t act on time. In order for society to respond to the extremity of climate change, we have to work together in order to make an impactful change in the way we live. Otherwise, nothing will get done and a possible extinction could be our future.

After reading the article, one factor that was deeply in my mind - “the timid language of scientific probabilities”. The article contains a lot of shock factors which alarms us about terrible situation of Earth, and it shows many scientists’ research results, but why the factor of scientists’ timid language will carve in my mind? Think about it, the information we got today, no matter from news or class, they all come from scientists’ research. The language scientists had need to be accurate. They can’t use the “absolute” words. So their reports always contain the “uncertain” words which people always ignore its importance. Scientists trying to use the most accurate words to alarm us, while we always forget the uncertain words are actually equal to the word “absolute”. People like to reduce the risk they saw. For example, the article tells people the results of the temperature rises to two and four degrees, but people can only remember the result of two degrees because they thought the rise of four degrees is far away from them and even it’s impossible. I believe this is actually the main point why people still not act to save the earth, the misunderstanding of the scientists’ reports and the “ability” to reduce the risk.

It is true that some people are misunderstanding what scientists are trying to portrait the environment we are going to have. Nevertheless, I think not only people are misunderstanding the data the scientists are providing to us, but also they are seeing the fact and the results that are going to be led to as science-fiction-like, which makes a lot of people not willing to believe that the problem of climate-changing is really hitting us, and some of them do not believe it at all. However, ironically, the science-fiction-like result that people are imagining is truly what is going to be happening; it is just too hard to believe what we have done has this huge impact on the environment. Instead of just knowing the stone-cold numbers, people should also realize what could happen to them. Like what has been said in the article, the earth will be too hot for people to live on, there will be no food for us, diseases are spreading, thin air, fighting over the sea, even the downfall of our economy. All of those are lying in front of our eyes, and those are what, I think, should really be seen.

Changes in the earth’s atmosphere, biosphere, and climate resulting from anthropogenic forces is not newly introduced science. In the 1970s, scientists expressed the harmful effects of CFC emissions on the atmosphere that led to the Ozone Hole crisis. When the cause of these harmful CFCs, aerosol sprays, were pinpointed and the crisis was effectively communicated to the public, hairspray and other aerosol spray sales dropped, progress was made, and the Ozone Hole is now expected to recover by 2050. However, in 2019, the overarching climate crisis is only now being addressed on the global scale with recent movements such as the Global Climate Strike and new promises of more comprehensive climate policies by world leaders. The gap between human acknowledgment and action towards mitigating global climate change can be largely attributed to ineffective communication focused on instilling fear instead of inspiring hope. 
       <br><br>
The evidence and arguments presented in David Wallace-Wells’, The Uninhabitable Earth, are truly terrifying to read, especially as someone lacking economic, political, or social power. I  don’t mean to say that we should give up trying to mitigate climate change because the problems are all too overwhelming or that individual actions can't lead to significant, collective change. I just feel that Wells’ alarmist approach is a poor model of communication to general audiences that is more likely to result in complacency rather than catalyze change by doing little to offer feasible solutions. I firmly believe that effective communication such as gearing information to appeal to specific groups or making suggestions that regular people can implement into their lives can be more successful than simply dumping paragraphs of potential ways the world will deteriorate if climate change continues to worsen and expecting the reader to figure out what to do about it.

After reading the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I would say his article was more thought-provoking and interesting than most of the environmental films and readings that I have read in the past. A lot of environmental articles usually conclude by saying Global warming will result in a tremendous amount of world disasters such as sea level rising, causing cities to flood, more natural disasters, or some type of economic crisis, but with Wallace he goes on to further his articles by adding in how this dramatic environmental change with deeply impact human lives. For example, when he mentioned the Amazon Rain-forest, which provides 20% of planets oxygen, and how the changing of the weather patterns will most likely cause more droughts which will lead to more fires causing the rain forest to become less dense and drier. Even within this year the Amazon has already suffered recording breaking fires which will surely have a long-lasting impact on the biodiversity of the rain forest. I wouldn’t necessarily call him an alarmist because it he isn’t over exaggerating anything in his article, most things that he has stated will eventually come true if we don’t come together to at least attempt to fix it.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" did a great job of covering all the different aspects of our lives and relation to the planet. I don't think he would be an alarmist because all of these changes have been evident for awhile and it seems that the general public tries to ignore it. It seems that he is trying to scare people into action but I think it's completely necessary if we are going to do anything productive enough to save the planet. Even worse is the fact that most mass extinction events have occurred due to greenhouse gases -- something I wasn't aware of prior to taking this class. This alone should be adequate evidence that climate change is not a myth or a debatable topic. It's very sad that the countries (the US) that are producing the most damage to the environment will be the ones that don't experience the consequences nearly as much as other countries that don't contribute much at all. I never imagined that the industrial revolution and development following that could produce such a change in climate in such a short amount of time.

In David Wallace-Wells’ ‘The Uninhabitable Earth’, Wallace-Wells brings up often undiscussed, but nevertheless terrifying, aspects of the climate crisis as they pertain to human activity. The first sentence of the article promises readers that it’s definitely “worse than you think”, going on to offer up examples such as Norway’s Svalbard seed vault to discuss melting permafrost and the 11 mile-long crack in the Antarctic ice shelf resulting in a process called calving. Despite these very real, contextual examples of the some of the potential impacts of climate change, Wallace-Wells also acknowledges how these things have long been ignored, both as a simple rejection of said scientific findings or even as denial of the problem at hand. 
       <br><br>

Though Wallace-Wells takes an inherently alarmist perspective on this issue, it’s not a ridiculous nor superfluous way to communicate this information. Oftentimes the measurements that define the ways in which climate change is spoken about are convoluted and inaccessible to the average person with average knowledge on the subject; that being said, the direct approach of stating what exactly needs to be done to reverse the damage done, however terrifying it may be to some folks, is absolutely necessary. There is no room for underestimation when it comes to accepting how humans have negatively impacted our earth.

After reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” my eyes were opened to several ways our life could end due to the cause of climate change. In his article, Wells explains several harsh effects of Global Warming. The one that I thought was most interesting was Climate Plagues, which was how diseases trapped in arctic ice from many years ago, could be reborn when unfrozen. This was very alarming because there are several diseases from long ago that killed off a lot of the population, therefore I can only imagine what would happen to us now if these diseases were reborn because we would not have an adequate immune system to fight them off. When reading it, I did not feel a sense of panic, but rather a sense of determination to do something to prevent these things from happening rather than trying to go back when the damage has been done. 
       <br><br>
After reading the article, Wallace did sound a bit alarmist, with his use of diction when using words like, “unbreathable” and “poisoned” to describe the way earth will be left, but I think it was the best approach to get people to realize the seriousness of climate change. This could also bring panic to the reader, but after realizing these are the consequences if we do not make change then it will probably make the reader want to learn more about what they can do to change it.

The annotated version of "The Uninhabitable Earth" notes that the five sentences beginning with "What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response." were the subject of much debate. The paragraph is a clear attempt from Wallace-Wells to define his own place in our current climate narrative, moderating his own alarming data ("It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized") and pressing into it ("But those scenarios, and not the present climate, are the baseline. In fact, they are our schedule.") The annotations on the article question whether the focus on worst case-scenarios was "irresponsible", while Wallace-Wells critiques science on the whole for self-editing so severely as to not present the most devastating possibilities. 

       <br><br>

My response to these questions comes from my experience in the field of Writing Studies. I believe it is far more important to question whether Wallace-Wells's approach was responsible given the broader conversation surrounding the climate crisis than it is to question whether his approach would be responsible if his article was the only publicly available climate research. When acknowledging that Wallace-Wells's article is taking place in a much larger conversation that has been fraught with reservation and outright denial (or considering that a typically well-informed Stanford grad like my father can be deeply unsure about the reality of significant anthropogenic climate change), it seems to me irresponsible to NOT put voice to the most drastic eventualities. In my mind, an intertextual silence on these possibilities would be condemning to the worldwide scientific community.

Like many, I once thought climate change was not a rigorous situation, at least in my generation. However, after reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I realize the serious consequences caused by climate change such as heat death and unbreathable air will no doubt happen in near future if we do not take action immediately. In fact, the result of climate crisis is already happened around the world. For example, in recent years, hottest temperature has been recorded as well as the largest wildfire in CA. In that case, I strongly disagree that Wallace-Wells' opinion is too alarmist. On the contrary, I believe he objectively mentions the truth and the harsh situation we are facing; meanwhile, he is trying to rise our attention about the climate change.

       <br><br>

Though many counties has made the effort to reduce the rate of rising temperature - like the Paris agreement that many countries promise to control a no more than 2 degree rise - there is no enforcement mechanism to do so. Besides, according to "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, even 1.5 degree rise will lead terrible consequences. Thus, what we do currently is not enough to stop or reverse the future doomsday. If the fossil fuel companies keep overusing the resources for their own profits or other things that are not environment-friendly continue hurt the Earth, we will soon taste the gloom. Therefore, everyone should be aware of the situation we are in and take action to slow down the rate of rising temperature.

After reading the article "The Unhabitable Earth," by David Wallace-Wells, I can tell how urgent this climate change is and how it could get worse in the future if nothing happens soon. I can't help but mention that Wallace-Wells pointed out that scientists who are the most educated on the topic are the most optimistic. Many ordinary readers may be alarmed by what Wallace-Wells writes, but if people become educated on this issue and spend their lives trying to stop climate change, then we shouldn't be scared anymore. As the article notes, we as humans have evaded extinction many times through our own ingenuity, so we can fix the state we are in now. That doesn't mean the problem isn't big, because it is and has to be solved, but it's not worth giving up on. The most effective option would be to do something about it and make a difference in the world.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by Wallace Wells goes through in large of what our Earth will look like if we continue to lack sufficient consideration and action for the climate crisis.  Wells points out many considerable problems that can arise from climate change including the effect on crop yield, deadly heat waves, ocean level rise, ocean acidification, plagues, ozone smog and more.  He may seem alarmist, but he has plenty of evidence to prove otherwise, proving that none of his predictions are exaggerated.  However, Wells was brave in that he did not hold back when expressing the severity of the climate crisis situation, which could push conservative readers away from caring or believing the facts.  For me, the article put me at the edge of my seat, despite already being very aware of the climate crisis.  What was most compelling to me was how climate change can lead to wars over competing for natural resources.  The public is already struggling to form an effective movement against climate change, but it may become near impossible to maintain even the movement we have now if we find ourselves distracted by war.  

       <br><br>

I really enjoyed "The Uninhabitable Earth" over other climate change articles in particular because "The Uninhabitable Earth" was different with how Wallace Wells was not scared to go into details how severe our situation is and how grim the future can be.  I would definitely recommend this article to climate activist friends, but not for many of my conservative friends as I think the article would fail to respond to their differing priorities.

As I read the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I couldn’t help but feel fear for what the future may have in store for our planet. David covered how multiple aspects of human life will continue to be affected by climate change, some aspects in which I never even considered before reading his article, such as it’s effects on the economy and wars. It made me realize how daunting climate change truly is, as it affects the most important parts of our world. David mostly discussed the future of these effects and how they will progress if action is not taken soon. This progression is what I fear the most, along with anyone else who is aware of the seriousness of climate change. It’s quite crazy how there are so many who are not aware. David brings this point up, as he questions why so many people have yet to be truly educated on climate change. Given how much it has changed our world overtime, and knowing that if this change continues the effects will be distressingly bad on our planet and lives, why hasn’t climate change become a topic in which everyone is educated on? People will not be driven to help climate change improve if they are simply unaware of why it needs to be. David ends his article by reassuring us that people will act on improving climate change before it truly becomes uninhabitable. My worry is how far we will let the effects of climate change progress before significant change is made to improve it.

I haven't seriously thought about how serious the global warming is before reading the article,"The Uninhabitable Earth", and watching this video. In the very first section of the article, David Wallace-Wells illustrates that the doomsday is coming and the melting of the permafrost is happening. It scares me right away because from my knowledge, it will not melt forever. It is also said that the powerful hurricane occurs more frequently and more widely than before because of the climate change like global warming. People might not relate those issues with global warming or climate change, but after reading the article many people including me will be shocked by the facts. However, many governments have not taken enough actions yet, which is really disappointed. To tell the truth, I thought the panic of the global warming was far more exaggerated by some scientists and we can do nothing to control it to happen before. Many of my friends and families do not take it seriously, but I believe now I need to tell them the truth. It needs the contribution of every generation of people to control the rising of the temperature under 2 degree Celsius. I will share this video with many people to let them now the truth and facts.

According to the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, written by David Wallace-Wells, I clearly recognized the serious and harsh climate problem that the earth and all people are facing in modern society. However, before I read this article, I never imagined how serious these problems are. I believe that most people in the world are like me, who have no idea about what caused climate change, how serious this is, and what kind of consequence that exactly may happen in the future. Although experts in this area are trying their best to call on people to stop some behaviors which are harmful to the climate, people still do a few corresponding to prevent climate change from becoming worse.
       <br><br>
In the article, David mentioned some consequences that will happen in the future if people still choose to do few actions to prevent, which include heat death, the end of food, climate plagues, unbreathable air, perpetual war, permanent economic collapse, and poisoned ocean. No matter which one took place in the world, part of the world will be destroyed by it. These words used by David are influential and will make readers begin to reflect on our actions. These passionate proposals proposed by David will let more and more people begin to worry about this problem and reconsider their behaviors. People should not think that David is exaggerated, instead of it, we should consider a thing seriously. In a word, people should prepare for the worst. If David does not use these words, people may still consider global warming isn’t a severe problem and do not focus on it. As time goes on, the problem will become worse and worse until the problem cannot be solved easily. However, as soon as people realize how serious global warming is playing in the world, the problem of this serious climate change can be solved. People should not be afraid of the consequences caused by climate change after reading the article written by David, instead, people should clearly think deeply and begin to take actions to prevent this thing happening, which influence their offspring’s life.

Before reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I had assumed that it was going to be another article simply about what humans are doing to destroy our earth and how it’ll eventually be uninhabitable in certain places, maybe closer to coastlines and such.  I also figured he would talk about the stuff that is emphasized in the mainstream conversation of climate change, sea levels rising, extinction of certain animals, and the rate at which the earth is heating up.  I was obviously looking at this from a very ignorant perspective.  Although he does touch on all those topics, he goes about it in a way that makes his audience feel foolish for thinking that’s all there is to climate change.  The article is written as though he knows his readers are going in with this blind viewpoint, and that is why he is so successful in his writing.
       <br><br>


The intensity at which Wallace-Wells does his writing is admirable.  The first few paragraphs he writes to introduce the topic are moving, shocking, and most obviously, terrifying.  Ken emphasizes the idea of climate alarmism throughout his video and I believe that is a very important concept to touch on when dealing with an author who writes in the way that Wallace-Wells does.  Many may say that he is a climate alarmist, but I personally believe that takes away the importance of what he’s saying in his writing.  Yes, the way he is writing is meant to scare us, he is doing it on purpose. What is happening to the earth IS very scary and threatening.  If you type in “climate alarmism” into google the first things that come up are articles on why climate alarmism is bad and that it is not a good method of action.  But I believe the way Wallace-Wells writes is a good way to get people to want to take action, and to get people informed on the truth.  Nowadays people would rather brush the topic of climate change under the rug and go on with their day.  People will do anything to avoid added pressure or stress to their day to day life.  Wallace-Wells makes it plain and clear that this is not something we can risk avoiding for much longer, he forces his audience to look fear in the eyes and hope they’ll do something other than stand their petrified.

While reading the"Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace, the severity of climate change opened my eyes to the state of danger we are in. It is terrifying that the damage we caused as a society isn't wanting to be resolved in the same manner. Some people believe that climate change is natural and the urgency around it is extreme while others do not believe in it at all. We need to come together in order to try and create a better tomorrow for future generations. Wallace highlights that climate change is here and is already impacting the planet as we speak. The bleaching of coral reefs, migration of species and diseases, and food scarcity shows that we can not just blanket the effects as the rising of ocean levels. People seem to not consider that we are connected to the entirety of the planet and as long as there is no change we will be dragged down as well. 
       <br><br>


Humans always believe that they are the exception. They push the idea that climate change will not affect them because of their societal class, the actions they take in their everyday lives, or because they put the responsibility of creating the solution to others. In reality this a very selfish approach to climate change because they do not consider the people who already are feeling the impact of climate change and the impending doom that will strike us all. We are not invincible
       <br><br>


I do not think Wallace is an "alarmist". The possible outcomes that can arise if no action were to be taken are grave and extremely petrifying. We need to be made aware of the possible future we may be living in if we do not take action. We need to feel the weight of our actions not only on ourselves but on future generations. We will be leaving them with the hardest puzzle to solve as well as generational anxiety, if we do not become responsible for our  actions and the state of the Earth.

Straightaway, I would like to thank David Wallace-Wells for creating this article.The article is truly life-changing and alarming to humanity. Like the other comments, I was expecting the context of the text to be dull and obvious. After all, I am pretty well-aware of the existence of Climate Change. However, as I read through the entire article, I found myself really indulging in the issue. Specifically, the topic of  five mass extinctions under “Doomsday” that has heavily impacted Earth in the past. I found that within all five mass extinctions, there was a shocking similarity among them, these extinctions were heavily triggered by climate change. For this reason, great minds all over the world like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk claim that humanity should survive through these extinctions by inhabiting other planets.David Wallace-Wells is not simply educating the public through facts or research of Climate Change, but rather, alarming humanity that our time is running out if we do not take action regarding the warming of Earth.
        <br><br>

Additionally, I find the issue of “Permanent Economic Collapse” really frightening. David Wallace-Wells mentioned the idea of fossil capitalism. Although I am well-aware that humanity is continually burning fossil fuels that eventually contribute to climate change, if humanity continues to burn fossil fuels, it will eventually ripple and create a variety of changes towards agriculture, energy, mortality, and labor. Hence, I find it alarming that every time we burn fossil fuel, it contributes to the heating of the world which will eventually lead to a great economic collapse that we cannot sustain. David Wallace-Wells did an excellent job in mentioning this in the article as economic devastation is hard to comprehend by society and is often, the foundation of our livelihood.

In “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, the author does not shy away from being direct and straightforward to the reader. I was taken aback by the unfiltered worst-case scenarios of climate change such as the spread of diseases like Malaria and the prediction that by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be dealing with it. With it being now 2020, 2050 is not into the far distant future that the consequences of climate change seemed to be. Another wake-up call is that heat is already killing us. I was surprised by the fact that 1/5 of the El Salvador population is suffering from chronic kidney disease because of the extreme heat that they have to work under. The most troubling aspect of this issue is that they were able to work comfortably just two decades ago but now they become ill because of climate change. One thing that surprised me was the fact that we did not start to economically prosper until the discovery of fossil fuels. This leaves me to wonder how we would be today if we never exploited fossil fuels and how we will be once we are forced to stop exploiting. Overall, the alarmist view of climate change inspires me to take action rather than crumble under fear because action is what it takes to prevent the aforementioned catastrophes.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I was in shock at how little I didn’t know about the declination of our world due to so many smaller aspects of human involvement than I could ever have imagined. I liked to have thought that I had a decent understanding about the effects of people’s actions on the climate crisis based off of the major harms we induce due to actions such as burning fossil fuels and producing waste, however it is clear now that the issues dig so much deeper and on a much larger scale. 
        <br><br>

While I was unaware of some of these dangers, I think that one of David Wallace’s best points in this piece is where he explained that there is a large amount of people who do understand the true scale of the problem and some who have the power to assist in mending the issue yet they don’t. I think that no matter how many times people are informed about the problems at hand, nothing will continue to get done unless we begin to enforce calling on people to alter specific aspects of their lifestyle and outline the exact procedures rather than just explain the problems. I think that personally for me, if there were more articles or information in the press about specific and attainable lifestyle changes for everyone of all demographics to follow, it would be more powerful than becoming aware of the problems and not feeling a personal need to fix it. 
        <br><br>

Another one of Wallace’s points that grabbed my attention is where he explains that the climate crisis has spiked most recently since the reality of it became known to people. It is worse now than it has ever been even after the most emphasis has been put on solving these issues in this period of time. People are ignorant of these warnings and I think that unfortunately some of that might have to do with the way people perceive the press now. The amount of junk information that is fed to the public on a daily basis has infected how much people trust and/or pay close attention to what they see or hear.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth”, you realize that the issue with climate change is far beyond sea levels rising. Our only option is to solve the problem because feeling won’t be enough. After the readings, lectures, and film, I know that sea level rising, permafrost, fossil fuels, carbon increases, and greenhouse emissions are all contributing to our climate crisis. The article attempts the issue in a way that allows the readers to understand that we have a problem but it’s also time to address it. The article also mentions how much damage there’s been in just the lifetime of a teenager today. Our future isn’t going to be as we are right now in terms of the health of ourselves and the planet. We’re living through a climate crisis, but human beings are just moving as if there’s nothing better to do. I thought it was nice and clear for the article to list all of the consequences of climate change and described in detail how our earth would be impacted. The article had a sense of reality and some sort of hope for our environment.

After reading the article I understood everything from lecture more. David Wallace Wells went into detail of all the disasters that will happen due to climate change. Our future is scary because we are always going to be faced with a disaster that could be either drought, hurricanes, heat waves, wildfires, or diseases that can affect us. It will only get worse as we continue to sit back and do nothing about it. I agree how humans have not realized how bad climate change is, they have seen all the disasters that have occurred and are continuing to occur and still believe climate change does not exist. The future upholds the death of most of the human population due to unbreathable air that will suffocate the majority.

In his article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", David Wallace Wells identifies a complacent, self-contented attitude even from people who think that they know how disastrous climate change is. He states that when it comes to "real world warming dangers", people are not imaginative enough because sea level rising and the destruction of coastlines across the globe are only a very small part of the damage climate change can bring. I think that Wallace-Wells purposefully uses an alarmist tone in this article in order to spur the fear and urgency that is needed today. In order to shake the reader out of that complacency and mentality that somebody else will take action, Wallace-Wells takes it upon himself to point out the extreme figures and really emphasize the climate crisis we are in. On the other hand, using this alarmist approach could have adverse effects on the readers. Wallace-Wells doesn't speak on the things that the individual can do to combat the inevitable destruction of our planet, he never lists any steps we can take. Solely naming the consequences of our actions could make it seem as if there is nothing we can do and that the 6th mass extinction is inevitable.

After taking English 22, and through pursuing a degree in environmental studies, I would consider myself a very knowledgeable person in regard to dangers of climate change and the looming devastation that comes with it. However, after reading the article “An Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, this terrifying future seems all the more eminent and severe. The article has inspired me to view the climate catastrophe with pure terror and rage. When presented with all of the environmental consequences that have either already begun, or will in the near future, I can’t help but to mourn for the sake of humanity, and to feel completely enraged by the idiocracy of those who still ignore the existence of climate change, and how we as humans are ironically destroying our own future.
         <br><br>

I don’t see Wallace-Well’s article as alarmist, while his article is quite alarming, it is based entirely on scientific fact. Wallace is not an alarmist because he is simply educating the public about the consequences of our actions. However, the purpose of “The Uninhabitable Earth” isn’t only to educate readers, but also serves a purpose of influencing people to take action. For example, David Wallace did include information about the Permian-Triassic extinction, to help his audience envision the likely future of our planet and put it into perspective. The article also addresses the lack of understanding in how climate change will and is affecting all aspects of the natural world, not just rising temperature and sea level rise. The most eye-opening topic that Wallace brought up in the article was how war is a serious side effect of climate change. Coming to the realization that climate change is also affecting human behavior is alarming, but makes complete sense. The more I learn about what’s happening to our planet, the less optimistic I become. Reading articles like this one leave me completely devastated, yet I still somehow have hope that climate change can in some way be reversed or stalled.

In the article "The Uninhabitable Earth", author brings out several facts to prove that climate change is much more urgent than most people think, which makes me feel anxious about the present and future situation of the earth. There are millions species live on earth and human beings are not the only one who live on Earth. But climate change has made living lives difficult to survive. With the rising sea level, soil erosion, higher temperature, severe wild fires and more powerful hurricanes, living beings are struggling in a place to live in and reproduction cycles of some creatures are badly interrupted. As a consequence, the number of species drops sharply compared to historical records. From my previous perspectives, I did not believe much in the opinion that humans are most responsible for the climate change, since Earth has its own cycle of destruction and regeneration. But as I read the evidences that are stated by Wallace-Wells, I stated to believe that humans have the duty to slow down the climate change and help out those innocent animals and plants.

In David Wallace Wells article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, he startlingly presents the plethora of issues from plague to war to economic collapse, that arise as the climate warms. At the beginning of the article I found it interesting when Wells pointed out how “scientific reticence” meant that scientists were failing to communicate the severity and urgency of the situation. It is in this way that I too agree with Wells’ demand for a shift in the way the climate crisis is presented. As it stands now, the manner in which the climate crisis is communicated needs to be radically changed so that the issues these scientists are presenting are not depicted or interpreted as negligible.
          <br><br>

Although I was already aware of many of the effects that would be brought about with climate change I did not previously know the extent to which all of these effects were interconnected. I was surprised to have learned how many people were killed in the 2003 European heat wave and how with the melting of permafrost would reintroduce ancient plagues back into society, potentially resulting in millions of deaths. I also did not think about how a global increase in temperature would create more ideal conditions for certain organisms to thrive such as mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus. Additionally I think people fail to realize just how important the ocean is to us and how ocean acidification not only poisons the oceans but every organism interconnected in its food chain, including humans. 
         <br><br>


This article was successful in evaluating the effects of climate change by not only looking at environmental repercussions but also economic, political and social consequences that will also be brought upon in the coming century.While shocking and depressing at times, I think this article presented the implications of climate change in a necessary way that exposed the reality of our situation.

Before reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I thought it was just going to be one of many articles that I have read before about climate change; however, this article is way more detailed than other articles. I, and I’m sure many others, are aware of climate change and is something that requires immediate action, but we aren’t fully aware of all the changes that will come due to this crisis. I, for one, only thought about how the melting of ice will result in higher sea levels and cause flooding along the coasts. I never thought about how the melting of the ice would release many diseases that have been trapped there such as remnants of the 1918 flu. 
          <br><br>

I don’t think that Wallace-Wells is too alarmist in his article. He is simply informing the audience of the drastic changes that await us in the future due to the climate change crisis. This article did get a little dark and made me feel like we are doomed. I don’t believe that we can stop climate change at this point, the most we can do is slow it down. Unless we are able to extract CO2 from the atmosphere, we will continue to see disasters. The only way to change our course is if everyone makes that change, which I think is highly unlikely. Once people realize that they need to make a change it will be too late.

My first thoughts after reading this article was that the author was addressing climate change in a very urgent and almost stressful way. David Wallace - Wells describes the consequences of climate change if we do not respond quickly and powerfully in great detail.  He makes it very clear as to where our planet is heading without any present action and that it is unlikely that all of these warming conditions will be fully realized.  As I was reading, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear or concern for my planet’s future, but I was also confused as to how so much of our nation seems to be unaware of David Wallace-Wells’ listed consequences. After watching the intro videos based on the readings, I realized that this is because Wells is considered an alarmist. I was also able to conclude that the melancholy mood of the text reflects how serious Wells is about this topic. Each line is read in a very serious tone, as he makes several statements about the Earth running out of time before climate change brings it to its devastating demise. I also noticed that the article presents each of the author’s concerns in a clear way with nine different sections. This made following along and understanding the content easier. I also appreciated that the topics the author hit were relatable to all readers; any reader could feel affected by at least one of the author’s warnings and concerns. 
          <br><br>
I personally was most intrigued by the third section: “The End of Food”. World hunger and starvation is a pressing issue today. I learned about the misconception of world hunger in my Soc 1 class last quarter, and while reading this section of the article, I was able to make several connections. In Soc, I learned that we produce enough food for everyone in the world to be fat, but the reason why there is hunger in the world is that most of the food is being fed to livestock. In this article, David Wallace-Wells states that climate change is affecting crop production and the amount of fertile dirt there is on Earth. Places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature and even a small percent of warming will decline their productivity. These facts and statistics Wells includes throughout this article are his tools for educating our nation about our future. He believes it is unlikely that the large amount of damage caused by climate change will be fully realized by the public and he writes this article in hopes of shaking us out of our complacency. He gives a look into what our lives would be like with a 2-4 degree Celsius rise; just one possible future.

It is obvious that David Wallace-Wells has a very alarmist perspective and his tone in the article induces a sense of fear and urgency. However, I believe that his tone is appropriate considering the situation that we are in. I share a similar alarmist perspective as him, and that is why I decided to take this course. Around two years ago, I read an article with similar arguments, and that is how I became invested in climate change. Yet, for other people, there is the possibility that they may think he is overexaggerating. Regarding the topic of climate change specifically, I believe that a little exaggeration may be helpful because you never know when it is too late to save the environment. Perhaps it will take an incredibly devastating natural disaster to make the world realize that the climate crisis is real, but only under the sacrifice of many humans, animals, and nature. 

          <br><br>

The scariest fact that David Wallace-Wells brought up was the notion of “Heat Death” and that people can actually die of heat, especially those working outdoors. The reason is because I have an illness that makes me prone to problems in hot temperatures or cold temperatures. I can definitely tell that compared to 5-10 years ago, my body has been a lot more susceptible to joint pain, fatigue, headaches, and other problems due to irregular temperatures. This makes me think about the world decades from now on - how will my body react and if it can even handle it?

I think that everyone needs to read the Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. This article tackles the basis of our warming earth, and addresses what we can do about it. We live in a time where peoples stances on climate change vary greatly from straight up climate change deniers to "alarmists", and I believe reading this article gives the information needed to really understand why we need  to act on combating climate change. It is scary to think about living in a world succumbed to, and irreversibly so, to climate change. Many people just don't understand what is actually happening, so they are quick to deny climate change. I personally don't think that someone could be "too alarmist"in regards to climate change. Everyone should be a climate change alarmist, and that is probably the only way we will be able to reverse some of the damage already done.
          <br><br>
I think that bringing up the harsh truths about our future is the only way to get people to actually DO something about it, and Wallace Wells did this in a way that not only makes us scared for our future, but also want to act on it.

Wallace-Wells states that we armed the Earth with apoplectic tools of war the more we exercised our God-given dominion over it. In the face of that introduction, “The Uninhabitable Earth” hardly seems “too alarmist” when events that Wallace-Wells predicted in 2017 came to pass only two years later. Within the fifth section of the article, titled “Unbreathable Air,” Wallace-Wells briefly mentions the “terrifying possibility” of Amazonian forest fires, as if it was almost too awful for him to contemplate. In 2019, about 3,500 square miles of the Amazon was lost to fire. And as of today, Australia burns. As I write this, the estimate of burned land is about 12 million acres, or 32,400 square miles. When I search for updated statistics, the words “extinction crisis” flash on my screen, echoing Wallace-Wells’ reminder that 4 out of 5 major extinctions are attributed to climate change. On the face of an Earth that is adapting to our actions in a way that makes it inhospitable to life as we understand it, I can’t, in good conscience, claim that Wallace-Wells is “alarmist.” The reality of the climate crisis is alarming. Reporting on it is not.
          <br><br>

Likewise, I don’t think that Wallace-Wells is too alienating or forceful with the article, as this wasn’t necessarily a piece written to provide band-aid solutions to such a large problem, or even to convince deniers of the existence of the climate crisis.Neck deep in the rising evidence, either we understand the science behind climate change, or we do not. No single article can tip the scales of understanding at this point. Beyond that, most people “hip” to the climate crisis know all of the usual tips: buy second-hand! Go vegetarian! Carpool! Take shorter showers! Vote! If anything, “The Uninhabitable Earth” is not meant to convince readers that we can solve the climate crisis. The climate crisis is happening as we speak. It has caused irreversible damage to our planet, between mass extinctions and habitat alterations: burned land can’t be unburned; melted glaciers can’t be frozen once more; dead species can’t be reanimated; hurricanes can't unhappen. This is not a solvable issue, BUT it is a mitigable one. As Wallace-Wells wrote in his follow-up article “Clearer Picture”: the best case scenarios are out of reach, but we aren’t automatically resigned to the worst ones, either.
          <br><br>

Regardless, no matter how “good” or how “bad” our future will be, life will be irrevocably changed. After all, our very biology is conducive to exterminating us in a warming environment. The section “Heat Death” stuck with me the most; as someone from the greater Los Angeles area (San Gabriel Valley, to be more specific), I know that heat is deadly. Every summer, people in the city—the poor, the sick, the disenfranchised in life—die from a lack of adequate shelter from the heat. With rising temperatures, “adequate shelter” will soon be inaccessible to everyone except the incredibly rich, as Wallace-Wells notes. Even more personally, people with chronic illnesses like my mother will be stripped of any high quality of life in rising temperatures. Overshooting two degrees Celsius likely means that I’ll spend the rest of my life as a caretaker for an increasingly ill woman, before the heat quietly smothers me as well.
          <br><br>

“The Uninhabitable Earth” is very much a heavy read, and was difficult for me to get through at times. The sheer magnitude of the article lends itself to the phenomena that was described in section nine, titled “The Great Filter”: dreamtime, observing history while it is in the process of being made. I think often of Okjökull, the Icelandic glacier who melted so much that it lost its glacier status. Okjökull received a funeral plaque: “This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it. August 2019. 415 ppm.” By this point, the climate crisis can not be reversed. However, humans are ingenious critters, and we have methods of alleviating our suffering on the changing Earth. We just need to mobilize now to make a difference later.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth," I was very overwhelmed. I think it was an insightful read because it highlighted a variety of effects that climate change is having on our world (particularly his points that are not directly associated with the environment, like the inevitable rise in plagues and warfare between countries - much of which we are already seeing). I didn't leave the article inspired to make change, but stressed that we've already lost all the time we could have had to save our planet. With that said, I think its important to alarm readers into making change and given his intent to underscore the sensitivity that most scientists have been having with honestly portraying climate change, he served this purpose well in his writing. 
          <br><br>

However, I personally don't think that an alarmist approach is the only approach necessary in stimulating action. In fact, I think the reason why a majority of people turn a blind eye to climate change, is because nobody wants to deal with and try to understand dire, disturbing and the complex material that articles like "The Uninhabitable Earth" give. I think this is just a result of an innate quality humans have that basically defines their inability to understand suffering in a productive way. Nobody likes being told what to do, let alone shaken to the core about an upcoming apocalypse. Yes, this definitely shows a weakness in the human relationship with climate change, but nonetheless it's something that I think should be taken in consideration when discussing climate change. 
          <br><br>

At the same time however, the alarmist approach can be productive and is essential in our discussion today. I don't think the discussion of climate change would be as highlighted in the media today without it. Activists like Greta Thurnberg, turn this alarming quality into influence, which is even more powerful given her young age at 16 years old. Thus, if anyone should take on the role of being alarmist in the discussion of climate change, despite backlash from non-believers, it is the younger generation (Gen Z). This is resulting from the fact that we and our children are ultimately the people that will be affected by climate change the most.

Week One’s article is “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells. The preface of this article gives me a shock in the first place, “Famine, economic collapse, a sun that cooks us: What climate change could wreak — sooner than you think.” Before reading this Wallace-Wells’ article, I have never thought of climate crisis would bring that much disaster except for sea-level rise. After that, I think I should have read this article early, and I will definitely share the article with more people who are blindly optimistic about the current planet scenario. Throughout “The Uninhabitable Earth,” Wallace-Wells has talked through human itself and all kinds of environments that we live upon, step by step, delivering alarms, even more, heavier each step. From the very first topic, he has given the readers an astonishing series of data. Continuously growing climate temperature not only contributes to the sea-level rise but, most importantly, release a tremendous amount of methane in the ice. Methane is the most dangerous greenhouse gas, which, under years in ice, is 68 times as potent as carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.
           <br><br>
Moreover, as the temperature keeps rising, the food supply will gradually come to an end because the production rate will drop due to every one-degree increase in global temperature. Besides, the sea will be poisoned, the economy will collapse, and a lot of living species will even not endure hot to death. All these kinds of predictions in the future are terrifying. I begin to realize we can at least do something to prevent our planet from coming to the day in the article that soon. The earth needs us to take action as quickly as possible. And the article does an outstanding job of calling for actions for all the readers.

<p>
“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells could be considered a difficult article to digest, but it is a necessary read in order to understand just how dire the consequences of climate change could and will be.  Like many others in the comments, I believed I was adequately educated when it came to the topic of climate change and environmental problems as a whole. However, after reading the article, I now see that I’m not educated enough. When we think of the climate crisis, we may just think of it in a general perspective, and understand that things have to change, but we might also seldom alter our actions for various reasons. 
           <br><br>

Wallace-Wells sort of uproots that perspective and forces us to look at the specifics: these regions will suffer and eventually perish, these countries will become completely uninhabitable...and it will be inevitable. Though those thoughts in themselves are frightening, I don’t believe Wallace-Wells should be considered an alarmist. He takes away the comfort and blissful ignorance of the audience by presenting them with these situations, and though we might feel anxious and uncomfortable by his article, it’s important to acknowledge what he is saying in order to instill within us the need for urgent change.

<p>
Before reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I believed the majority of the threat about climate change was temperature rising, which would lead to ocean levels rising, leading to human relocation. After reading the article, however, my viewpoint has been totally broadened. Not only is climate change a danger to us on the surface, it has underlying consequences that the average American may not realize. One of the underlying consequences that I found most interesting was how climate change can affect the health of humans and possibly lead to death. The Heat Death was one particular matter that caught my attention. The idea that we as humans could turn certain places people call home today into an uninhabitable world of scorching hot temperatures is frightening. Our actions of the past could cause future Middle Easterners to leave their homes or die from the extreme heat. Another similar problem is found with the diseases buried within the ice. Diseases such as smallpox and the bubonic plague were found trapped in Siberian ice. With the warming temperatures, the fear of the ice melting and releasing these diseases into the world can have catastrophic results. In addition to releasing deadly diseases new regions will have to deal with tropical diseases such as malaria and zika virus. This is crucial because for example, many Americans may believe that we are safe, yet with the change in climate, we may have to battle the likes of the plague and viruses that we never had to face previously. To top off all the possible destruction, the change in climate can lead to war. As more and more land gets overtaken by water, less resources become readily available, causing many countries to go to war and fight for resources. This will only lead to more death and suffering upon the many other issues that are sure to come with climate change. I believe this article by Wells is very important because it highlighted underlying issues many do not think of. Those living inland may think that they’re not near the ocean so sea level rises do not affect them. Truth is, everyone will be affected by climate change in some form another and it is our job to fix it. Wells is therefore not an alarmist for this article as he is merely doing a great job of warning us what will happen if we continue our father down this dangerous road.



</p><hr>



<p>
I totally agree about the dangers facing our industries. If we continue with business as usual, there will eventually be no one alive, and therefore no way to continue any form of economy or business whatsoever. Fossil Fuel corporations and factory farms fear changing their ways due to the financial risks, but fail to consider that in an extinction event, profits drop to 0. It’s terrifying and infuriating that these corporate giants are able to force climate change forward, even with so much resistance from the people of the world. 
            <br><br>
Wallace-Wells is far from an alarmist. There is no way to communicate how dire this situation really is. His urgent tone and clear descriptions of possible extinction events were the only way to get his point across. People should be scared, and they should be freaking the fuck out all the time! Those who care need to care enough to make up for those who don’t.
            <br><br>
The most terrifying thing to me about this crisis is the helplessness it breeds. While there are small differences every person can do to make a difference, that can only do so much. Policies and laws need to be put in place to limit pollution for corporations. Unfortunately, these very politicians benefit from the profit of these corporations due to the nature of money in politics. Our planet must be saved by protest en masse by those who wish to see it saved.

<p>
In regard to the question of “is Wallace being TOO honest?” My answer is there is no such thing. Wallace starts the writing off with a sentence letting his readers know that he won’t be tip-toing around our feelings: “It is, I promise, worse than you think.” Personally, I think this is a great way to start a conversation about climate change. Why? I think too many people are hesitant to take this topic seriously or take actions to help the climate crisis because we have, for far too long, been doing what Wallace avoids: tip-toing around feelings. I think when it comes to the climate crisis, we HAVE to be serious and we have to install some fear into people in order to get anything done. I feel as though unless someone reads or hears about the climate crisis as Wallace talks about it, nothing will be taken seriously, and people will continue to think it isn’t a big deal and that we still have more time to act. He then goes on, “If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible…” This was a great way to start the writing because if we’re being honest…rising sea level is the probably the most common and most talked about concern when it comes to the climate change. However, as Wallace points out, there are far more eminent and life-threating dangers concerning the climate crisis. The most compelling result of climate change that Wallace mentions, in my opinion, is the unbreathable air. This was the most compelling to me because I hear a lot of people come up with excuses as to why they aren’t concerned about the climate crisis because “they don’t live in areas near the rising sea level,” or “only the poor will suffer.” Unbreathable air is a reality for EVERY type of person no matter where they are in the world and that should wake some people up to the dooming reality of the climate crisis.

After reading the article ‘The uninhabitable Earth’ by David Wallace-Wells, It gives us an objective and clear way to tell us the fact we are facing about climate change. The article gives nine aspects to illustrate the influence that climate change are bringing to us. Heat death, the end of food, climate plagues, unbreathable air, perpetual war, permanent economic collapse, poisoned oceans and the great filter. All of this are destroying the earth. As he describes it in his book, the changes that will have an impact in the coming thousands of years have been reflected in various kinds of overnight crises. These changes range from the sun's light reflected by the earth to the ability of all kinds of microorganisms in your body, and all of these are disappearing. Wells focuses on what global warming, the most direct manifestation, higher temperatures, rising sea levels and extreme weather mean to humans? On the other hand, wells ignored the disasters in the natural world. For example, he did not elaborate on the loss of biodiversity or the details of the great secret we have experienced. Although he reminded us that only one of the past five major extinctions was caused by a small planet, what happened to the other four? We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a fairly rapid rate. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change predicts that if emissions continue to rise at the current rate, the earth will experience as much as 4.5 ℃ warming by 2100, the permafrost in the Arctic is already melting, and it is likely to release a large amount of methane, while hydrogen sulfide is thought to trigger one day, which will lead to the extinction of the end of the Permian. 
            <br><br>

In the ‘The cautious case for climate optimism’, Wells pointed out that although many people are aware of the speed of environmental degradation, they still pretend that everything has never happened, but they are consuming the earth's resources at a faster speed, which is mixed with a lot of complex factors. The combination of the sense of superiority from the perspective of political economy and the West leads to the continuous improvement of human tolerance to the pain limit, but wells' purpose is not to describe fear The future of terror is not to cut off all hope. Wells hopes to use this book to help people face the reality and reshape the way we treat the environment until the future of the earth can be saved.

In the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,”  David Wallace-WellsWells stands an alarmist view while he is talking about the cold reality humans have to confront. Our earth is turning to an uninhabitable place for us human step by step. Before I read this article, I never realized that our earth is so sick that the climate crisis becomes serious, and many animals are extinct. This is an extremely dangerous thing for us. For example, if maggot extinct, then this will be no animals can decompose those animals’ dead bodies. So there will be a disaster for our environment. However, some of us still refuse to accept this common sense. From this article,  each section introduces different topics towards climate crisis, like “the end of food”, “perpetual war”...It reminds me that if we still do not do something to protect our environment from now on, There will be no food and water left for our future generations. With the information it transfers to us, I propose that we need to utilize some methods to save our environment, for example, we can separate our trash into different kinds, plant some new trees every year, permit less pollution from the factories, save more animals’ lives.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” by David Wallace-Wells, I definitely do not think Wallace-Wells is too alarmist. Often, news about the climate crisis details what has happened, not what will happen, and this makes it even harder for the public to imagine what our future will look like. Yes, this article makes me want to sit down and cry - but not forever, and definitely not in lieu of action. It is hard reading this as a student, when it seems as if our actions can’t be enough to balance out the inaction of the decision-makers, generations above us. The levels of climate anxiety I see in my peers is almost incomprehensible. Many of our generation have accepted that the apocalypse is coming - and the world doesn’t seem to care that our generation will have to reckon with it. Wallace-Wells only echoes that our fears are not unrealistic, and the “optimistic” ending is not quite convincing, when climate catastrophes and effects keep happening, without any change in public or political narrative.
            <br><br>

I thought Wallace-Wells’ explanation of the end of our food supply was the most compelling, as well as the emergence of new and old plagues, although all of his predictions were striking and alarming. I really liked how clearly he set up the consequences of climate change, as the majority of climate literature seems to paint the future as terrible but not actually explain how and why our lives would be so different. At this point, we need “alarmist” perspectives on the climate crisis, because it is this dire and change needs to happen now, before the climate catastrophe spirals out of human control. The planet and lives we are living today are not habitable for our children. This is an emergency, and it is time it’s treated as such. Climate deniers may be put off by the message, but I don’t believe it would be more convincing to soften the message. Eventually, hopefully soon enough, the magnitude of information about the harsh reality of climate change must be enough to convince us to act.

Throughout reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" I felt as if there was a blaring alarm that echoed from ear to ear spelling disaster and minute chances of hope. And while yes, this is extremely frightening and disabling as a whole, it is a rather important alarm to hear. As Ken and Wallace suggest, humans are complacent in our nature and would not usually change or alter what is familiar to us without any direct harm to our livelihood and familiarity. As a race, we need to see the outcomes of our destruction and bear witness to how we are ALREADY seeing the consequences of hasty industrialization. How it is that a bloody, violent, death-filled revolution hasn't already toppled the systems that allow for such pollution and planetary self-harm to take place I will never understand. But dire actions need to be taken, and as harrowing as that sounds, I hope our race has what it takes to not follow down the same path as our biological ancestors.


Funny it is even, how we can become so developed but die at our own hand because not only can we not all recognize there is an issue but make necessary adjustments to curve the effects of the problem we created. What stuck out to me most from the Wallace article was the idea of the Great Filter and the expiration date on civilization which begs the question, "why haven't we witnessed other intelligent life?", answered funnily enough, by the notion that we must not be so intelligent after all. It's a scary and unimaginable thought that we could witness or are currently witnessing another major extinction event but will only be so until 97% of us are dead and our planet is uninhabitable. And it might not even happen to us, or our kids, but what lives will their children endure, and how long will our species remain on the cognitive notion that the only thing that matters is what happens in our lifetime? I am definitely scared, but equally ready to go out and share everything I've learned because once we're all scared we can finally do something.

<p>
When I read "The Uninhabitable Earth", I was scared of the consequences that Wallace-Wells listed, but fear was not my main emotion. This article made me angry. Our world is dying and it feels like no one is doing anything to stop it, or at least, no one is doing enough. I want to do something, I want to fix something. Now, I understand that this article may be a bit much for some. I know humans find small problems much more alarming than large problems, but since I have already dealt with learning about the climate crisis for some time, I think I can take in this large plethora of problems with more ease. If someone were new to learning about the climate crisis, I wouldn't start them with this article, but one that focuses on an issue dear to them (for me, that would be the death of monarch butterflies).
            <br><br>
Of all the issues listed in the article, the one that seems the most dangerous to me is heat death. So many of the other issues seem like they will be accelerated by heat death. If portions of our planet become uninhabitable, we must leave there, which causes migration, which ups tension, which causes war. We can no longer plant food in places we can't live, so food must be planted elsewhere as well which takes more living space and exacerbates the issue. In fact, the most awful thing brought up by Wallace-Wells was that these issues caused by global warming can and will cause more global warming! 
            <br><br>
Sometimes I fear that I can never really do my part in stopping the climate crisis. I am just one person, I've already cut out meat, I've already stopped participating in fast fashion. But these issues are still occurring. I am one person, but that does not mean I can only change my small impact. This one small person has one large voice, and plans to use it to help others change. This article scares me, but it scares me into action.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells he clearly states and outlines what will and is happening to the earth because of climate change. I think this was a good article for me to read because while I know that climate change is occurring I can't say that until I read this article I knew all of the effects it would/could have. With that said, the article follows a very pessimistic tone. It’s written as if this is our future and the doom that we will all face. I think because of this style it can have both positive and negative effects. I think it scientifically shows the seriousness of the issue and addresses how so many humans have not or can't imagine this world. At the same time, I think it can also make the reader feel like this problem is bigger than them. Which it certainly is there are still actions that can be taken by individuals to help address climate change. Overall, I do think that this article is a good source to inform people what our world would be like if action is not taken. For example, I know that before I read this I did not know the extent of heat death we could reach or even think much about it. This article created a greater sense of urgency for me, so I only hope it has done the same for others.

I was intrigued by the concept called scientific reticence brought up in “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells. Scientific reticence means scientists edit their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was. I’ve read many articles and news about climate change before, and I still failed realizing how serious our situation is since scientists are always claiming that we still have many ways to deal with this. Wallace-Wells’ article does alarm me about the serious situation, especially when he mentioned about the idea that even if we do not use fuel, we will still lose them in a century. This is truly horrific. I suddenly realized that I was just blinded by how the scientists what me to believe in. “No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.” This time, it is no longer phrasing in “few” or “maybe”, it is “no.” And I think we should take this seriously now this time.

David Wallace Wells painted a portrait of a very ugly future, and yes, it was alarming. But people should be alarmed. To dismiss climate scientists as "alarmist" is to ignore the very real possibility of self-destruction. In "The Uninhabitable Earth", Wallace Wells emphasized several positive feedback loops which will speed along the effects of climate change. Some of these we can already see beginning. For instance, he mentioned the Amazon rain forest, which provides our planet 20% of its oxygen, commonly known as the lungs of the earth.  Changing weather patterns mean more droughts for rain forests like this one, which means a higher chance of devastating fires, which in turn shrinks the forest and makes the area even drier. Just this year the Amazon suffered record-breaking fires which will have a long-lasting impact on the health of people nearby and biodiversity of the rain forest.

            <br><br>

Some people, when faced with this shocking truth - that we are years away from massive devastation - will no doubt be overwhelmed and simply turn away from the truth. Climate change is a huge issue that has no simple answer, a fact which sends people spiraling. However, it is important for the worst-case scenario to be portrayed honestly, or we will be completely unprepared for the day that it inevitably comes.

<p>
Before reading “the uninhabitable earth”, an article published by David Wallace-Wels, my understanding to global warming is merely the rise of sea level and the submerged coastlines, which is totally abstract to me in that the effects it brought is far away from my life. It is unnecessary for me to concern about the topic since the place I live is far away from the sea, which has little tendency to be drowned. Therefore, global warming is a topic only for researchers and meteorologists rather than the ordinaries — us. And I believe most people will share the same idea with me. Nevertheless, when I finished the article, I was astonished by the fact that components like food, air, and etc. ,which are essential and even indispensable for our lives, is closely related to global warming. And can you believe it? Even the five mass extinctions, which are the most significant historical events, are caused by global warming rather than the most prevalent theory — striking by asteroids. Then, in fact, global warming needs to be the concern of everyone since if we still stay outside and consider it irrelevant, the consequence of climate change brought by global warming will destroy all human life as the revenge for damage we done to earth. 
            <br><br>
Unlike most articles, predicting what will happen a few decades later, David focus on every detailed consequence the global warming may well bring to us if we still refuse to take action. He hopes to ring alarm bells in the minds of us and force us to take some action to reduce the emission of Co2, the major culprit of global warming. But in reality, most people refuse to accept those statements since global warming is a general topic and most of them lack relevant specific knowledge about it. Moreover, they are too scared to think the consequence it will bring —the disappearance of human. However, even though we are afraid about those consequences, we should be optimistic since those warming consequences are likely to avoid if we take appropriate measures. Like David mentioned in the end of the article — “all of the scientist have strong confidence to the ingenuity of human beings and when we do truly see the world we’ve made, we will also find a way to make it livable”.

<p>
The author wants people’s attention on climate change since too many people have not realized that the severe situation that we are facing and the problem is worsening. 
            <br><br>

Because before knowing all kinds of details and predictions of how climate change can affect each person on the planet, I simply think the issue should not be my very concern. It is just 1 or 2 degrees hotter, and air-conditioning can fix the problem solely. I believe many people feel the same way and that we should just leave this to scientists and politicians. However, Wallace makes an interesting and compelling point on how air-conditioning would not be the solution to rising temperatures, and in fact, it barely solves the problem. The use of air-conditioning aggravates the carbon problem. Moreover, many people who reside in the hottest parts of the earth usually cannot afford air conditioners. As a result, they may die from hotness. 
            <br><br>

Dying from hotness is just one of the many ways that lead to our extinction which Wallace lists in his article. Maybe another title for this article could be “The eight ways you can die in the future, caused by climate change.” Death is something that humans are afraid of, and I think Wallace is taking advantage of it. To some extent, this article might cause some fear, but it is not necessarily a bad thing. It gives us a real warning, and ho we should start to avoid things that aggravate the problem. This is how humans get to survive and evolve for thousands of years, even though there exist millions of ways that cause death. 
            <br><br>

There is one problem, however, after I read this article with dense information. I feel a little bit hopeless. After Wallace lists all the possible consequences of climate change and comes to a point where he explains the solutions. Wally Broecker, one of the godfathers who identified the climate change problem, thinks no amount of emissions reduction alone can meaningfully avoid problems. And it looks like the only way out is to come up with new technology that can somehow impede the growing temperature. The problem seems so big and I feel I cannot do anything about it to make a change.

<p>
After having finished reading the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" I was shocked about how many claims David Wallace-Wells had made about the consequences of climate change. I was already aware of a few dangers of climate change but not to the extent of what I had read in his article. I always thought that the impact climate change had on the earth was not that bad; I was immensely proven wrong and shocked when reading about how much of an impact climate change had on the earth and how it is impacting not just the earth itself but the animals and all the resources as well that we need to survive.



</p><hr>

<p>
At first read, "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells was quite alarming to me. I would argue that he was a bit too alarmist because he painted this unavoidable, horrible future. With barely any shreds of optimism, Wallace-Wells mentions frequently that certain fates are pre-determined and there is nothing we can do about it because things are already turning bad. For example, Wallace-Wells says that Miami and Bangladesh will die in this century even if we stop burning fossil fuels. Yes, hurricanes are already getting stronger and our oceans are being poisoned right this second, however, I don't agree with his tactic to scare and leave readers feeling hopeless. I've read other climate crisis articles and the difference between Wallace-Wells' and others is that he does not give a solution or optimistic ending. His ending is rather unavoidable and scary. I feel like he could've made his argument more effective by stating the facts, describing what it would be like if we do not try to reduce our carbon emissions, and then raising a plan of action. I know that there are feasible solutions that every citizen can take on and should take on. The problem is not a lot of people are aware of how dire the problem truly is. I think his article will help to show the severity of the issue, however could be improved by giving solutions that every person can take on, such as switching to a plant-based diet. Without this offering of a solution, as a reader, I was left feeling hopeless and distraught. After reading about how our food supply of grain is doomed to plummet, I felt like this issue was very serious, however, I did not feel the need to do my part in preventing the problem from getting worse as Wallace-Wells made it sound like there is nothing that can be done to reverse the damage. On the other hand, after observing other climate crisis films and articles, I felt inspired to stop eating beef and to shop sustainably, and actually followed through with these solutions in my life. This feeling of hope, although it may be small, should be passed onto the readers. Without adding in glimmers of hope to inspire readers to take action, educating the public on the climate crisis is almost a waste. 
            <br><br>

Although I do not agree with the hopeless feeling Wallace-Wells pushes on the reader, I think he successfully expresses the severity of the issue. All of the statistics he prevents truly shocked me. I have heard of sea level rising and causing harsher weather patterns. However, I admire how Wallace-Wells goes into more detail. He paints out every aspect from our food, surviving the heat, air quality, tipping points,  poisoned oceans, and even climate's effect on social order. He highlights so many aspects of our lives that we take for granted. The most alarming fact to me was the tipping points of permafrost and the albedo effect. Wallace-Wells explains that arctic permafrost sequesters 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, however when thawed, all of the carbon will be released, as strong as methane. It was striking how ice melting not only raises sea level, but contributes to global warming as the ice that once reflected heat off itself with its white surface will no longer do us that service once it is melted. These insights on aspects beyond sea level rise and harsher weather are not seen in a lot of climate crisis articles and films. He has done his research and truly captures every part of our life that we take for granted now.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, David Wallace Wells mainly talks about a large amount of serious reasons that cause climate crisis. David Wallace-Wells 's extreme and tough attitude and tone to warn the audience that if humans continue to not care about environmental issues, unscrupulous destruction of the environment will lead to the gradual warming of the earth, and in the end, it will bring irreversible results, and even human extinction. Many opponents think he is exaggerated. They critics he is a “alarmist” who tend to create alarm and terrific outcomes without reasonable explanations . Actually, I strongly agree with David Wallace Wells’s opinions. I do not think he is a “alarmist.” The author just wants to remind the audience that environmental problems are really serious. After reading this article, I felt some pessimism and depression. I didn't realize before that a small act that we may have inadvertently caused will cause huge damage to our home planet.

<p>
It is accurate to label Well’s as an alarmist, he is after all, outlining every worst case scenario in graphic detail. However, many people that use this label to describe him are using it as a negative term. Since the 1980s, scientists have been sugarcoating the fate of humanity as a result of CO2 emissions, opting to use less harsh language in hopes to avoid panic. 40 years later, and we are still on track to ruining the future of humanity, so I don't know how good of an idea it was for people to make it seem like the issue wasn't as grave as it is. I respect Well’s for putting it all out there, yet the facts temperature rise, melting ice caps, the albedo effect, rising sea levels, war and crime, and heat death are overwhelming when given all at once. In fact, the magnitude of what we are doing to this planet, is straight out of a movie, and therefore, pretty unbelievable. Even as an ES major, it’s hard for me to fully comprehend how radically the world is going to change, and what that will mean for my life and the lives of future generations. 

            <br><br>

When he outlined the nature of heat death, and the fact that NYC, where I spent almost all my summers, would reach deadly temperatures in the summer, I realized how different the world was going to be. Imagine being unable to exit your home for months of the year, imagine what will be able to survive that environment. Well’s seems to be outlining an unbelievable future, but whether one believes it or not, we have to begin understanding the implications of doing nothing. When will it be too late? Australia is already burning, viruses have already begun to spread, hurricanes have already displaced millions of people and destroyed communities. It’s not “just the weather.”

<p>
The article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” focuses on the consequences for climate change that will ultimately make our planet “uninhabitable.” As many other articles warn about climate change, Wallace reiterates the same dangers referring to a collapse of the economy, war, and the rise of climate driven diseases in more detail. Although he was attacked by other for his alarming nature, these predictions about the near future prove that there is no other approach to be taken. There is no more time to sugar coat the facts about climate change. One thing about the article that I enjoyed is that Wallace brought up our ignorance to climate change- or “climate denialism.” This idea seems to be more prominent in first-world countries where we don’t see our own homes being flooded due to rising sea levels or our crops dying to famine and unpredictable weather. This blind eye will ultimately lead us to our deaths as we cant even imagine the scope of climate change and its consequences. Many articles on climate change  aren’t able to actually influence people because they are not alarming enough. People wrongfully put faith into technology, that has proven to be a pretty good tool, to help get us out of the problem. However, if we ignore climate change much longer, no technology will be able to save us. 
            <br><br>

As human beings, there has alway been a sense of superiority and  dominance we carry around, especially since the dawn industrial revolution. Yet, we have not be able to fully dominate nature and all of its complexities. It’s time we accept this is one problem that wont be easily fixed and we take action now.

<p>
After finishing reading the article "The Uninhabitable Earth", I changed my attitude toward the climate issue thoroughly. I didn't take climate change as an extremely serious issue in the first place, instead, it is a much more severe thing that I have imagined. Prior to reading, I thought I knew enough about the dangers of climate change and increased carbon emissions like the green house effect, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification. Nevertheless, I immediately realized that those effects were just scratching the surface. There are so many either natural landscapes or resorts that have been severely damaged. This article truly helped me take a step closer to see through the climate change issue. 
            <br><br>
From my perspective,  there is some truth to calling Wells an "alarmist". He derives several possible outcomes with a sense of urgency and I believe that he is well aware of the alarming rhetoric and alarming way he portrays the topic of climate change. The truth of the matter is that climate change is quite an essential matter, it should be explained in an alarming way to catch people's attention.



</p><hr>

<p>
While Wallace-Wells' article is likely to instill fear in those who read it, that is his ultimate purpose. The magnitude of the climate crisis is so large that such fearful rhetoric is needed to, as he says, "shake our complacency" to inspire action and prevent the worst of the events he described from happening. As defined by many in this comment section, an alarmist puts excessive value on a "needless worry or panic," which most definitely does not describe the climate crisis. However, I do agree that the article's somber tone did make me feel incapacitated by fear, feeling like I had no control over the fate of the climate. Thus, I would argue that Wallace-Wells should have ended his article with a list of ways to get involved to engage his audience.
            <br><br>

I feel most compelled by Wallace-Wells' discussion of the Arctic permafrost, a topic that I had never been exposed to before. It astounds me that the potential of 1.8 trillion tons of carbon being released into the atmosphere (twice of what is there currently) is not being discussed as a daily issue. It also astounds me that these dire threats in general are not being discussed nearly as widely as they should, and that says a lot about human nature and tendencies.

<p>
In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, he shows the reader the big picture within each of the areas of development among other things. He clearly illustrates the consequences and impact of climate change through past decades, and even centuries, where he states that dinosaurs went extinct due to the repercussions of the emission of greenhouse gases. Not long ago, the news talked about the crack in one of the Antarctica ice shelves, which grew significantly in just six days, and like Wallace says “it may have already met the open water” by the time we’re reading it. It seems as if the mainstream does not emphasize the actual harm that is occurring on our planet although they mention that the poles are melting, they fail to acknowledge the different impacts on  the communities all around the globe. For instance, in El Salvador dehydration caused by the heat resulted in kidney failure which in the long term decreases life expectancy. Likewise, Wallace mentions the appearance of old bugs trapped in the Arctic that may carry deadly diseases and which some of them may date back thousands of years; this I found the most compelling. 
            <br><br>

Furthermore, population keeps growing while with every warmer degree, food decreases, as well as the forest season expands, diseases within the icebergs reemerge with mutations, social conflicts and crime waves increase, ocean acidification negatively affects the marine life, and many more effects from climate change. It is not all about what could happen in the future, it is about what is already happening! “Heat is already killing us”, it is happening now and Wally Broecker believes that reducing the emissions will not completely avoid the upcoming disaster, but to do something about it. In a similar manner, Wallace’s purpose seeks to get people to act by showing the impact of climate change on our planet.  It was believed that a rise of 2°C would be catastrophic; however, Wallace states that 2℃ would be, in fact, our best scenario and while reading this I realized how much I did not know. Even though many criticisms refer to Wallace-Wells as an alarmist, I believe the contrary. Nowadays it seems as if we have become careless and indifferent about the climate crisis so reading about the possible impacts allows us to expand our knowledge and learn about the many different ways in which climate change affects us either directly or indirectly.

By reading the article "The unihabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I noticed that It was my first time reading an article that descrided the details of climate changes and the possible outcomes caused by human beings on environment. And I found myself being truely shocked by the serious environmental problems caused simply by pollutions came from human activities.
            <br><br>
The article also tried to inform us the possible outcomes if people continue refuse to believe the negative impacts they bring to the environment, pointing out that there were still a great number of people tend not to believe the facts they human are one of the biggest characters who did harms to the earth and climate to make more people start to understand the importance 
            <br><br>
of releasing pollutions and start to take actions doing that.
            <br><br>
What's more, David Wallace-Wells did try to alarm his readers of the problems caused by human activities on climate and environment now, however it's also okay not to call Wallace-Wells an alarmist because he only tried to show his readers the things he got doing his researches instead of making people feel afraid by showing them what is gonna happen if people never stop doing 
            <br><br>
pollutions and the details of how earth and climate would be harmed by human activities. And by doing that, readers are more likely to start to accept the trueth that they need to believe and take actions to help reduce pollutions made by human.

“The uninhabitable Earth”
             <br><br>

As most of the movies I have ever seen about environment, the movies are trying to comfort people that if we try to do the things now, we could save the planet. But not this text. The writer David Wallace-Wells shows the situation of environment without any cover-up. By showing those horrible data, he wants people to know his purpose for writing the article: let readers feel fear from the deep of their heart and get rid of silence from groups. We do not really need hope towards the environment now, all we need is the fear. Fear is our last hope for action on climate change, according to the writer. 
            <br><br>

He is telling the people to stop waiting the environment to get well by itself, we have to do something to save it. And we do not really have much time as we think we have, the changing in the planet will not wait for human. We need to feel afraid, even need to be scared about how fast the environment is changing in order to put into practice. I could believe as long as we make the fast solution to face the environment, the whole society will be changed.



</p><hr>

<p>
After I read the article "The Uninhabitable Earth," I have learned the catastrophic effect of climate change and how will our future generation suffer from climate change. Wallace Well conveys the idea that the climate issue is closely connected to every one of us as we are the people who contributed to the worsening climate issues is pushing our planet Earth closer and closer to the cliff of the apocalypse. From the title of the article "Uninhabitable Earth", it is obvious that our Earth will be eventually become uninhabitable if we do not take action to slow down the climate change process. The article informs us of the inevitable consequence and reminds us of the necessity of slowing down climate change.



</p><hr>

<p>
An alarmist is a person who raises alarms by exaggerating dangers in society without sufficient reason, and Wallace-Well is definitely anything but an alarmist. He presented facts on the current state of climate change concisely with analysis backed up by researches and statistics. Although some believe that the “doom and gloom” style of his writing may cause some audience to disengage due to how fears affect reaction psychologically, I believe education is crucial to the efforts in combating climate change. In order to solve a problem, one must recognize and understand the problem first, and that is why recognition of facts and reality are so important. 
            <br><br>


In comparison to all the previous articles I have read on climate change, I think the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by Wallace-Well stands out a lot because it is extremely comprehensive and provides a lot of perspectives I have never thought about. Of all the consequences of global warming mentioned in the article, I found the concepts of climate plagues and perpetual wars to be particularly intriguing. In the past, there were theories that suggest the comeback of ancient diseases. They did not really convince me because I thought diseases cannot survive until the melting of permafrost due to the extreme conditions while being frozen. However, reading about an anthrax killing a boy and infecting others after the melting of permafrost truly is nerve-wracking. I was also very surprised to see a numerical correlation between increase in temperature and armed conflicts between regions (for every half-degree of warming, society will see a 10-20% increased chance in armed conflict). This says a lot about how interrelated human society is with the climate and global warming will only lead to the scarcity of more resources as well as more blood shed for those resources.

At first glance, David Wallace-Wells’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth” could come across as alarmist and “scare away” readers, especially with people who have doubts about the climate crisis or those who have not read many other climate change articles prior to this. However, as someone who has no doubts about the climate crisis, I think his article is not “alarmist” because it is based off of credible research, not over exaggerated statements about the future. I believe his article is meant to inform, not induce fear. 
            <br><br>

Many points stood out to me from the article. His estimates of climate change within this century, like permanent extreme drought by 2080 in southern Europe, worse than the American dust bowl, or how by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with Malaria, striked me the most because I will be a fully functioning human being during those years. It is scary to imagine that I will most likely live through these major catastrophes, and I cannot help but think it is inevitable. His article definitely made me more motivated to take action and do what I can do to slow down the crisis.

While reading the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" I was shocked to see how close we are to being extremely affected by the effects of climate change. Before reading it I knew it was close, but I did not think it would be as close as it is. I liked that the article went into detail about how exactly we will be affected and when exactly it will start happening. It also explained what will happen if the earth warms certain amounts. One thing that I found extremely shocking was that there have already been five mass extinctions and that four out of the five have been due to climate change. In school growing up, I only ever learned about the mass extinction that occurred when an asteroid killed the dinosaurs. Knowing that four mass extinctions have happened before due to climate change makes what is happening today much more real and scary. I was also shocked to learn that Doomsday, which was designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe, flooded less than 10 years after it was built. Although they say Doomsday is fine now, it can never be certain that it will work and help our agriculture survive. The article talks about how some parts of the Earth will be uninhabitable due to how hot it is. It says that the heat and droughts will be even worse than the Dust Bowl that happened in the 1930s. Droughts are a huge problem, because it turns a lot of arable land into deserts, which leads to less food since there is less land to grow it on. If this happens, we will have trouble feeding the population, especially if it continues to grow at the rate it is now. Not only will we have less food, but diseases will start to resurface and affect everyone. As the ice is melting, diseases that have been trapped inside will come out and people today will not be able to fight them off since we have never been exposed to it. Some diseases can mutate and become worse than they used to be as well, like the zika virus. The air will become unbreathable and the ocean will acidify to a point that many species that live in the ocean will die or be extremely affected. Reading this article has made me realize that there are many different ways we can be affected by climate change, many which can result in our deaths.

“The Inhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells accurately describes the urgency of the climate crisis. As mentioned in the article, scientists fail to communicate the urgency of the climate crisis in their reports or observations making the people believe that there is still time. Unfortunately, many of the environmental problems that scientists have been warning us about have already been happening. We lack resolve because people think these types of problems will happen in other places or they think that it can eventually be solved. However, David Wallace-Wells stated “No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.” Although it may be too late to prevent environmental problems that have already occurred, I believe it is still important to make an effort to stop any further damage to occur to our Earth. This article also brought to my attention many other problems that I was unaware about. For example, I did not know that with the melting of the Earth’s ice caps, frozen diseases that have not circulated the Earth can make a reappearance. This is only one of the many problems that will occur with the increasing temperature of the Earth. Other problems would include flooding, more wildfires, droughts, and more. It would not be fair to call people like David Wallace-Wells an alarmist because climate disaster has already begun.

David Wallace definitely does not take a laid back or modest approach to his writings ,"The Uninhabitable Earth" was interesting morbid and dark at the same time. While reading the article I had in mind the usual effects on global warming, sea level rising , storms , and extreme climate fluctuation. Yet I failed to realize that the effects of global warming can spread much farther that simply altering the weather and conditions of our planet. The illness that can come to surface with the melting of the snow caps are detrimental and could cause much worse panic, suffering and destruction that the preexisting effects of climate change. This will even have diresct impacts on poeples lives even in the developet world whoere people often take a tweet and retweet aproach to global issues. Even modern medicine might not be alble to cure the diseases that will find larg epolulations and spread quikly. It might be harsh to blame thouse in better off situations for the global crissis but it is sad to know that thouse most affected by this change our earth faces are poor communites and less develpoed parts of our world. 
            <br><br>

I believe if those who are skeptical of climate change would be aware of the personal effects that climate change could have on their life more action would be taken. Since the United States is the leading cause of CO2 emissions we need to take a stand as global power house to lead a change in our world before the human race has no chance at all at living in the world as we know it.I agree with mister David Wallece when he warns us that if we look to a “sugar coated” fantasy to fixing climate change without the use of political and enormous social reform the problem would only worsen as we comfort ourselves behind a false sense of aid toward the problem.

After reading David Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I realized the impacts of global warming are more severe than sea level rising. Influence of global warming is more comprehensive and terrifying from different angles. When natural disaster occurs, the existence of human culture will be challenged or even vanished since the scare natural resources might no longer available. In the article, the author points out the concerns of a rising temperature could cause food shortage since some crops have specific living temperature. 
            <br><br>

Before reading the article, I did not realize the serious consequences of the rising climate crisis. I used to believe animals and crops could adapt and survive climate changes since there were more serious climate situations, for instance Ice Age and Cretaceous Period had more extreme climates. But, the development of technology accelerates the temperature rising that leave limited time for animals and crops to adapt such change that cause a high amount of extinction of species.

In the article “ The Uninhabitable Earth”, David Wallace-well successfully shows the severity of global warming. He initially draws people’s attention by indicating the familiar and horrible word “ Doomsday”. Companying with a huge amount of striking statistics, he persuasively stated that global temperature is rising at an impressive rate. After introducing an overall idea to the audience, he mentioned the close relationship between climate change and human health. The high temperature and humidity are able to kill people just like the several huge distinctions of species in the past. Also, when the temperature rises, air becomes unbreathable because of considerable concentration of carbon dioxide and unhealthy ozone smog. In China, people has been suffering from lung problems these decades. Furthermore, global warming accelerated the spread of plagues. Frozen bacteria may be able to spread past lethal diseases and unstable climate patterns may enlarge the infectious range. Thus, global warming actually played a negative role on human health. Besides, climate change is likely to damage social stability, properties, and economic development. Coastal cities will be endangered and people may lose living security. Perpetual wars also disturb the peace of society, creating troubles between countries and races. Though the information above is frightening, I don’t consider David Wallace-well as an “alarmist”. He just displayed the truth and employed scientific statistics. Considering him as an “alarmist is incorrect since his purpose is to reveal the negative influence of global warming and encourage people to take action to save the situation. After reading the article, I felt that climate change is a serious problem towards the human being and it is mostly anthropogenic. In general, more people should realize the problem of climate change and try to make a difference.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, presented information regarding climate change in a way that was urgent and necessary for people to become aware of. I have read previous articles in the past on climate change, but Wallace-Wells delivered information in a clear-cutting way rather than just throwing statistics to readers. We are faced with the many possible consequences resulting from human activity.
            <br><br>

One fact I was surprised to read was that four of five mass extinctions on Earth resulted from climate change produced by greenhouse gas. With the rate we are currently producing, it only makes sense why some argue humans are driving Earth to its sixth mass extinction. The amount of Co2 emissions is only expected to increase unless we do something to stop it. Consequences to be faced in the future include many catastrophes including sea-level rise. Wallace-Wells mentions that places such as Bangladesh and Miami are predicted to be gone within the next century due to the melting of glaciers and rise in sea level. Millions of people live in coastal communities and will have been impacted by such climate change catastrophes. 
            <br><br>

Another piece of information that surprised me in the article was the mention of diseases trapped in Arctic Ice. It's terrifying to think that there are plagues trapped in the ice, waiting to be melting to attack the immune system of humans who have never been in contact with something like that before. Luckily, scientists have tested and mentioned they probably won’t survive the thaw. It’s still terrifying to note that diseases that can only be seen in certain places of the world are now traveling to others and are expected to migrate as the climate changes.

Wallace-Wells certainly paints a desperate picture of the state of our climate, and it is easy to see why many have called “The Uninhabitable Earth” an alarmist article. However the term alarmist is exactly how we should be feeling right now. After reading the article I was immediately called to action, angry that the repercussions of climate change are so vividly real, and so undeniably impactful. While some parts of the article look at the absolute worse case scenario, there’s no reason why a little fear shouldn’t be used if it helps get the message across that we are irreversibly damaging our climate. The article is well-written, if not somewhat dramatic, but it certainly brings to light how ignorant we are to pull out of the Paris accords, and how, despite “alarmists” best efforts, a significant part of the population doesn’t believe in anthropogenic climate change. I think that the article was a great kickstarter to get people moving and mad about the lack of involvement of our politicians. Also it’s so ironic because avoiding environmental regulations is good for short term business growth, but in the long term will lead to economic collapse.
            <br><br>

The most compelling case (in my opinion) Wallace-Wells makes is that of the oceans becoming poisoned. This past summer I was lucky enough to get certified in scuba diving, and Wallace-Wells’ vision of the future of the ocean makes me afraid. It is the most visible example of a negative impact on our environment that I can think of, and the destruction of so much vital biodiversity is very painful.

After reading The Uninhabitable Earth, I found this article almost covered every aspects of the bad effects which were brought by the serious global warming and carbon emissions. I have to say, this article shocked me with the facts that climate is also related with conflicts, wars, economics or diseases, which are aspects I have never thought before. Wallace-Wells began the book by criticizing all the fallacies about climate changes. The first saying is that climate change is a slow process, and we still have enough time to find solutions. However, that's not the case. The IPCC warned that we will only have chance to avoid the catastrophic result if we halve greenhouse gas emissions, and till now, we only have 12 years left. That’s not a long time since nowadays we even can’t find one perfect solution to every aspects of the bad effects. The second wrong idea is people lack the understandings of the scope of climate change, this is also my problem before reading this article, since as I said in the beginning, I never thought climate change may affect these many aspects. As I thought, climate change is just about melting arctic ice and rising sea levels. But, it actually means famine, hunger, war, submerged cities, droughts, economic chaos and disease in our lifetimes. Additionally, what makes me scared is that we are now just beginning to understand the scale of the problem, we don’t know and maybe we are not willing to know about what more will happen if we still can’t halve the green gas emissions or find solutions.  
            <br><br>

But, I still have to say, although this article gave detailed and comprehensive explanations on everything, I believe it paid too much attention on how to specify statistics to “scare and shock” people, and there is almost nothing introduced as solutions to help solve the inevitably produced pollution and waste. Even some of the “facts” seemed unreal and overestimated for me, I do agree that if we do not act to reduce carbon emissions, maybe by the end of this century, the entire planet will no longer be fit for humans to survive by today's standards and no longer possible to fulfill the growing needs for a better life.

I completely agree with your standpoint on this issue. This article shocked me at first too, learning about which country produces the most carbon emissions in this world makes me hope that we will take an aggressive stand to reduce our carbon emission production. Seeing how this effects our world  makes me worried about the future of  our planet. I am worried about what  will be left for our future children and families. We are leaving them in an almost inunhabitable planet. If we do not do something about this now, there will be no future. This isn't a political issue, it is a human rights issue!

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth”, I realize how much more serious the consequences of climate change are. Wallace-Wells includes some very interesting points of how the Earth will be affected that I had never heard about. For Instance, the past plagues that will be exposed if the Arctic continues to melt away. Plagues that have been frozen away for millions of years will be circulating the air. Unfortunately our immune systems will not know how to fight back since these plagues are prehistoric and have never been exposed to humans. Thinking about this makes me wonder why people don’t seem to be more alarmed about the crisis. Many people receive a flu shot each year to prevent sickness but are not aware of what the future holds if we keep emitting greenhouse gases into the air. It is alarming that if action is not taken right away greater diseases that are unfamiliar will be exposed causing epidemics and not prevention towards them. Additionally, Wallace-Wells mentions how there have been five mass extinctions on Earth. Most people only know about one which was the asteroids that killed off the dinosaurs. All the other four however were results of climate change produced by greenhouse gases. One of those extinctions killed off 97% of life on earth and we are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere ten times faster than then. Wallace-Wells does a great job of explaining what the future holds if action is not taken immediately. Many people downplay the magnitude of the situation and it is time to hear the harsh truth. 
            <br><br>
The time to take action is now and people need to be aware of how dangerous climate change is and how it will impact not only the earth but humans in order for them to take action.

The Uninhabitable earth brings up many important factors that are contributing to the downfall of our functioning earth as we know it. Wallace-Wells discusses what Doomsday is, Permafrost, Heat Death, The end of food, Climate Plagues, Unbreathable Air, Perpetual War, Permanent Economic Collapse, Poisoned Oceans, and the Great Filter. Wallace-Wells accomplishes much more than getting people to understand that the earth is warming up--he takes their lackadaisical procrastinator attitudes and shoves raw data and future predictions through real people and makes you realize just how worried you should be--and not later; right now.  

            <br><br>

I thought the flu shot example that Eustolia commented was a great example of humans are quick to protect themselves from a possible imminent threat that comes around each year, yet they cannot see just how imminent of a threat climate change is. If people treated climate change like the flu, we would make much greater progress towards climate change goals and prevent further damage.
            <br><br>


One point I found particularly alarming was that about the air pollution. The prediction that by 2100 our air will be so contaminated that our human cognitive ability will decline by 21% is a massive problem. People remain optimistic about the creation of new technologies to help the planet and rid it of carbon but how can they even study or innovate if the air they breathe drops their cognitive ability by 1/5th? 2100 is not as far away as it seems and if changes are not made now we are going to face some seriously bigger and scarier problems very soon.

In the piece “The Uninhabitable Earth” by Wallace-Wells there are various consequences of the Earth warming that I had failed to consider before. For instance, I was aware that ice was going to melt if temperatures continued to increase however I was not aware that the permafrost that encases the seed vault (Doomsday) in the North Pole was also melting. The seed vault is extremely value because it is designed to ensure that agriculture will survive any catastrophe. Not only do we need the permafrost to not melt because of the seed vault, but permafrost contains twice as much carbon as there is in the earth’s atmosphere. Wallace-Wells also brought up the point that the increased temperatures would mean that the human body would be cooked from the inside out since our bodies won’t be able to cool off. If the ice melts from the Seberian age smallpox and bubonic plague viruses will be released and our body will not know how to fight it. Rising temperatures will have a negative effect on crop yield since for every degree of warming means that yield will decrease by ten percent. 
            <br><br>

While Wallace-Wells did have some strong points, he was quite pessimistic in regard to what we can now do about this problem. He failed to provide any sort of solution to this problem and instead stated that no plausible program of emissions reduction alone could possibly be enough to prevent climate disaster. His pessimism leads to discouragement in the readers, because after reading the piece I felt that there was no solution to warming temperatures and now we would just have to bear the consequences of our actions. The entire piece came down to the fact that temperatures were going to rise and humans would die off from either our bodies burning from the inside out, having smallpox or the bubonic plague, or lack of food. This piece did not encourage me to make any changes, but rather just informed about the inevitable consequences.

Wow, "The Uninhabitable Earth" really exposed some of the dangers of climate and what lies ahead if we do not change specific human actions. Wallace Wells presents excellent facts and figures that first show our past in either CO2 levels or average surface temperatures that inspire readers to want to learn how we can do to make a different before it is too late. Given a lot of developing countries have began making sustainability improvements, if we continue changing energy methods, I believe we can reverse damages and change greenhouse concentrations in the atmosphere. Accounting for all the different factors, such has battery technology, solar and wind conditions, etc., make predictions, only predictions. The most important aspect is engaging readers to act and make changes in local communities.

Prior to reading the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I have perused some related articles about an unnatural weather change, ozone depleting substances, and the atmosphere emergency in secondary school. I realize that the atmosphere emergency is not mild today and will cause cataclysmic results both to nature and to people later on, however I never append extraordinary significance to these issues and I never consider putting forth attempts and activities to relieve these issues, in spite of the fact that it may not be useful for the time being. This article accentuates the seriousness of the issue and introduces a few potential results because of the atmosphere emergency from various viewpoints, which expresses the primary theme: a worldwide temperature alteration and atmosphere emergency make the earth dreadful and ungracious. I felt that the creator's work in asserting the realities and making conceivable expectations about outcomes that atmosphere emergency brought is essential and more individuals should know the circumstance we face today, however Wallace-Wells likewise makes revulsions and fears the crowd, making individuals in frenzy and making me feel sad about our living Earth. It appears as though there is no answer for change the circumstance and settle the issues. Somewhat, I feel that Wallace-Wells misrepresents the issue to cause us to be caution and focus, yet I accept that his objectives are acceptable to alert individuals and convince them to comprehend the circumstance and issues and to make a move. The second piece of the article is the most amazing one to me since it discusses heat pressure, which I have never contacted, and it is straightforwardly identified with human passings. Individuals may not get by in the Earth because of the outrageous warmth. Wallace-Wells guarantees that "before the century's over, the World Bank has evaluated, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are probably going to be hotter than the hottest months toward the finish of the twentieth century", which is stunning and surprising. This reality alarms me. The creator gives superb models and actualities to outline the issue and some of them break my convictions and give me a more extensive perspective on environmental change and emergency. When all is said in done, the writer posts a great deal of actualities and models, drawing in the crowd's status to focus on the issues talked about in the article. This article is educated and upgrades the comprehension of individuals toward the atmosphere emergency and its results. The potential outcomes are unsurprising and sensible, however they may cause frenzy and stresses among individuals. In spite of the fact that the circumstance is significantly genuine and incredibly dire, despite everything I feel hopeful about the future and accept that the circumstance is reversible as individuals everywhere throughout the world have awareness of atmosphere emergency and make a move to forestall further disintegration.

Indeed, the article by David Wallace-Wells is largely concerned with presenting the numerous ways planet and planetary life will die off due to anthropogenic climate change. Given the horrific prospect of the imminent run-away catastrophe brought about by deforestation (accelerated by wildfire), melting of permafrost, and the Albedo effect to name a few, the "doom and gloom" presentation of our future seems hardly out of place. However, the lack of detail given about any prospective solutions to this crisis does leave the audience with a sense of helplessness for the overwhelming task that is fighting climate change. 
            <br><br>


Unfortunately, while most if not all of the consequences outlined in the article have very real chances of really happening, it still may come across as alarmist to the reader. It is a tragic reality that our planet's trajectory is so dire that it's near objective truth should sound alarmist.

            <br><br>

What I found shocking was the continued complacency towards the issue evident by the 4.5billion tons of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere this last year. As for consequences to climate change, the tipping point of global stability is most frightening to me; the point at which the earth's numerous systems conspire to undo the years of life and evolution. While the idea of ancient plagues entombed in ice is certainly a frightening prospect hardly considered, it would be arrogant of mankind to hold some of these concerns as being most frightening. Lastly, I had never considered the idea of "Fossil Capitalism" but from the limited introduction to the concept is certainly compelling and I am happy to be aware of it.

In the beginning of "The Uninhabitable Earth," author David Wallace-Wells brings up the fact that he believes that scientists are not alarming the public as much as he believes they should. Scientific reticence, he calls it, is very dangerous in my opinion.  This article accurately portrays the risks we are facing by denying or simply ignoring climate change, while not filtering his thoughts.  I think a major issue with our media is that it usually only concentrates on one portion of climate change, sea level change.  . I think the reasoning for this capitalization on sea level change is being it is a tangible piece of evidence that many individuals can conceptualize or even see in their own communities, unlike ocean acidification which will not be likely to affect as many people in such a short time frame.  My favorite part about this article is that it was written for the normal person. Wallace-Wells uses language that many can understand, unlike other scientific journals. While he does use a lot of facts and numbers in the article, he also strives to make a personal connection with the reader.

When I initially came across David Wallace-Wells' article "The Uninhabitable Earth," I thought to myself that this would be another extrapolation of a cliche reasoning for the cause and effects of climate change by an enthusiastic environmental scientist. However, as I progressed through the article, the more and more naive, I realized I was being. This was much more comprehensive than what I have been told many times. The report wasn't centered around the burning of fossil fuels but touched upon an array of unfamiliar effects of the climate crisis. 
            <br><br>

What really caught my eye was the Climate Plague section, as it was something that never really crossed my mind. Additionally, as an economist, the Permanent Economic Collapse deemed to be very enlightening and exciting to read. A lot of times economists and environmentalists are seen as polar opposites however, this paragraph indicates that there should be a symbiotic relationship between economists and environmentalists.
            <br><br>

Furthermore, reading this article deemed to be really alarming as the current wildfires that are ongoing in Australia are in such dismay and are causing such large havoc within the agriculture and the habitat of the animals. Although Wallace may be a little bit on the harsher side of reality, it is what is needed in order to effectively instigate change.

As the first chapter mentioned, our doomsday may come soon. The scope of climate changes is so extensive that we are unable to observe all of them through our eyes. However, statistical data reveals the serious changes in the environment around us. The reality is much more horrible than we originally thought. We can hardly find a solution, and scientists have reached a conclusion: no plausible program of emissions reductions can prevent climate disaster. In the next part, Wallace-Wells introduced several threats to our daily lives from climate change. Increasing temperature itself is harmful because we can only survive in a certain range of temperature. Humans are similar to heat engines that need to cool off. Besides, increasing temperature brings more problems. The first one is food. Crops need to grow in a suitable environment. If the growth condition becomes worse, the productivity declines at the same time. If we keep doing nothing, our earth will be filled with more population and with a higher temperature. In this way, the world is unable to feed everyone-the hunger problem will worthen. In addition, the spread of disease is a big issue. We have no mutation to ancient plague that comes out from the thawing ice. Other problems caused by climate change, such as air pollution, wars, economic collapse, and ocean pollution, will lead us to a more vulnerable state. However, the sad fact is that a considerable number of people, among them even exist many celebrities, do not consider the climate change a fatal issue. By listing the current situation and major harms, Wallace-Wells successfully helps me to step into the movement of protecting our home. I believe other readers will have the same response. Everyone should work together to improve the world.

I am pretty shocked after reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells. In his article, Wallace-Wells points out some catastrophic consequences caused by anthropic climate change. This passage informed my lots of things I did not know before. It shows me that how climate changes can be closely linked to our society and daily life and how we are causing them. Wallace-Wells wants to tell us that our civilization and the entire planet are on the edge of annihilation. If we don’t immediately take action to protect environment, massive disasters and destructions would happen hundred years later. I party agree with his opinion. It is undoubtable that human activities have increased the global temperature and caused climate changes. I believe his perspective on heat death, climate plague, and unbreathable air is true. As a Chinese students, I am completely aware of the air pollution, especially few years ago. The visibility in Beijing and other major northern cities is less than 1 km during 2014. Everybody wore special breathing mass to protect themselves from the lethal PM2.5 particles. Even so, large number of people died because of lung cancer or other respiratory diseases. Moreover, the temperature is definitely increasing annually. I can’t even feel the winter in my hometown back in China this year. If Wallace-Wells is right about prehistoric bacteria, then it would be a true catastrophe for every living creature on earth because the glaciers in the pole is melting at a fast rate. It would be much worse than the black death happened in Europe during the middle ages.
            <br><br>

However, I believe Wallace-Wells is over-pessimistic. In his article, he is simply saying that the earth is in its doomsday. Although he is trying to motivate people to take actions in environmental conservation, he might cause the opposite effect. After seeing all the negative consequences, many people, including me, will form a sense of hopelessness and desperation, which will cause them to do nothing and abandon themselves because they believe it is already too late to take actions. Also, although he shows us so many troubles we will face, he does not tell us any practical solution to address these problems. Many people might want to save our planet but they just don’t know how. In my opinion, Wallace-Wells should shows some implements and methods that we could do to prevent those tragedies and pictures a brighter future after our actions. In this case, people will have faith and motivation to preserve the environment.

As I was reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, many ideas and data looks familiar to me since as an environmental studies majored student, I have seen so many articles related to global warming, climate change and their cause and effect. But in this article, David uses many data and facts from multiple aspects to inform, or alert, people about the consequence of climate change. Instead of simply piling data, he portraits a vivid image of what earth would be like if human being does nothing to stop climate change. Climate change is not a new term for me, but there is still a big amount of population especially in underdeveloped region that don’t know or don’t willing to accept the fact about climate change. It is impossible to conduct any practical action without knowing the it. What’s more, unlike some other crisis that could be solved by a group of scientist or politics, climate change needs the cooperation of all country from bottom to top. Since as David said that “that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved”, educating the public is even more important. Besides, there wasn’t any crisis that we ever met has such a profound impact that cover so many fields. Therefore, I think it reasonable and even necessary to spread the fear to society since the public will be motivated and prompted to do something about climate change.

As I read through the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", by David Wallace-Wells, I was shocked at how many different ways we'd be affected by climate change, other than rising ocean levels, increased storms, and dormant diseases. Wallace-Wells shows that all of the consequences are connected, and if we go about "business as usual", most of earth and our society will collapse.

            <br><br>

I feel as though Wallace-Wells does not risk too much by being an alarmist through his article. This is mainly because the number of people who would actually would be petrified after reading this article (to the point of hindering their actions) is so low that it's pretty insignificant. This just doesn't seem like a realistic outcome to me. Also, the type of people that dismiss his article, turned off by his alarmist approach, wouldn't really be moved by his argument anyways. For example, they might look at another hypothetical version of Wallace-Well's article, that's not alarmist but instead conservative/complacent in the information given, and dismiss it because it doesn't feel threatening to them. 

            <br><br>

Out of the multiple consequences of climate change Wallace-Wells lists in his article, I probably find heat death to be the most compelling. This is because of the sheer destruction it would cause to most of the life on earth. Most of the animals on earth wouldn't be able to survive the heat increases. Even though this isn't something we will see this century, most likely, it's still a disturbing image.

When I saw the title of the article, I was considering it will only talk about how serious the climate change is. However, after reading it, I cannot believe that the influence of the climate change is such great, and it not only affects human’s normal life, but also death rate, food productivity, release of illness, quality of air, economic collapse...... I was completely shocked. I used to think that if we take bus instead of car, if we accelerate economy by tourism instead of factories, the situation of climate change can be improved, but I was totally wrong. It is really really difficult and serious for us to change the current situation in a short period, there are so many problems for us to solve. For some of them, we even do not have any solution. In my opinion, what we can do is that thinking about how to control and stay in the same level and just do what we can do, for instance, closing down more factories, keeping finding another habitable planet and producing some machines that we can use for extreme weather.
            <br><br>
One more good thing in this article is that the author uses a lot of data, facts, and examples to help us clarify the extent of climate crisis. I believe that most people will think this topic is far from our life and too virtual for us to understand. However, in this article, we could learn it from every details in our daily life, what are we eating, what are we earning. It is concrete and reasonable, and analysis everything from professional perspective.

David Wallace, the author of this article reveals the causes, current situations, and the possible consequences of climate change in a comprehensive way, portraying the whole picture with nine different problems. He informs and warns the readers about things they might have already known or heard of in an extremely alarming way, but without exaggerating or twisting any truths because we the readers can tell from the numerous data and information he draws from interviews, experiments, studies, and research projects. Meanwhile, I was really fascinated while reading the article because there were indeed a lot of new lessons I never knew before taught by the reading. For example, I wasn’t aware of the disease and bugs and the huge amount of carbon stored in the ice and the permafrost of Arctic. I didn’t know that the increasing exposure to ozone for a pregnant mother will rise the risk of autism of her child. 

            <br><br>

I feel the most relatable reading the part of the article discussing about that climate change is the major cause of the unbreathable air in China. I used to live in Beijing from 2001 to 2010 where the smog became a really serious issue starting from 2008 approximately according to my memory. Little kids living in my neighborhood would be sick usually because of a sore throat, bronchitis, or a problem with their respiratory system, all of which affected by the air. 

            <br><br>

The alarmist approach taken by Wallace has been criticized by many, but I personally think that the anxiety and fear caused by this style of writing might not be a bad thing. Just as the article says, the scope and extent of climate change have been underrated and might be actually far beyond our estimation and imagination, so I think only when these emotions are stirred by writings like this, we can get enough awareness and attention, and hopefully more will take actions.

<p>
The expectations set for me going into reading David Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth” was that of disaster, the title is descriptive of life not being able to survive on the planet. My response to the article though is not as fearful than I initially thought, and I am thankful to Wallace-Wells for adding the worse case scenarios when it comes to the consequences of the climate crisis because as professor Hiltner had mentioned in the above video that many scientists only discuss the effects of Earth warming 1 to 2 degrees Celcius when we are on the path to having the Earth warming much more than that. In response to Hiltner’s above questions, I do not feel that David Wallace-Wells is an extreme alarmist, I feel like he is trying to educate the public and wants to include all the possible effects that the climate crisis will have on our planet if we do not take immediate action. Upon finishing the article I felt confused as to why the United States especially is not taking action to decrease their CO2 emissions, and anger that as a country the US is acting so cavalier to the consequences that we are currently feeling from the climate crisis. 

            <br><br>

Furthermore, on the topic of David Wallace-Wells being an alarmist, climate change deniers are the ones trying to use fear in convincing the public that the climate crisis is not real when experts like Wallace-Wells are just trying to clearly point out the facts that if humans do not change their actions then these are the worse case scenarios. When David Wallace-Wells was pointing out the specific consequences like heat death, famine, and economic collapse to name a few, reading it felt very doomsday apocalypse-like, and that made me start questioning my role in the climate crisis and what can I do as an individual, to help combat climate change. Overall, the context was not new to me on the topic of the climate crisis, but reading all of it and picturing every detail can make any young adult fearful of what is to come for the future of our planet if we don’t try to turn back now.

Extra comment: Reply: I am in absolute shock that people can justify discrediting David Wallace Wells as an alarmist and thus ignore most of what he is saying. This is a common tactic refuters of an argument do, if they find one thing wrong with it they then think that is justification to discredit the other side completely. David Wallace wells arguments are backed by science, tons of science, it must have took him so long to create that article. Furthermore, he went over the top and did an annotation responding to people who felt some of his points were too alarmist. I think, like you said Brianna, Wells was completely justified in revealing the worse case scenario. I was insanely shocked by the release of ancient disease that are historically trapped in ice. I think this article hit so hard to so many readers because it got us away from the previous notion of global warming: it will affect polar bears, some ice will melt and sea level will rise. Cool. This is not enough to inspire action. David Wallace Wells with an urgent and fearful tone saying "I promise you it's worse than you think", connects climate change to how humans will be deeply affected and will suffer if nothing is done. This was key to getting people to care about this issue. I loved the article.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” is the first reading that I read talks about the impact of climate changes. It efficiently concludes the consequences of human behavior towards the earth and ourselves. There are some points mentioned that I have never thought about it before, like the impact of CO2 towards the financial system. I cannot imagine that by 2100, there is a 51 percent chance that climate change lowers per capital GDP by 20 percent or more. We cannot be selfish and ignore the climate change anymore. It is our duty to change it for out future generation.

It is definitely our duty to keep the earth for our generation, and I appreciate your eagerness to make a change. I believe the fact that you mentioned that climate change would lower GDP per capita is very important. There would definitely be a day, sooner or later where the coporates that benefit from fossil fuels realize that they would not be making as much of a profit, even though it might be too late. Thus, we need to make them realize this important issue and act immediately towards any hostility towards our planet.

2. Article (The Uninhabitable Earth): Reading this article, I found most of the information presented to be things that I already knew or are presumable in the face of those I did. That said, it was nevertheless wholly depressing and discouraging. To present such concerning facts and predictions without any suggestion of hope for repair was a poor judgement call in my opinion. I understand why Wallace-Wells did it- to scare people into action- but I think he took it too far so that it had quite the opposite effect. In addition, he didn’t just scare about the climate, but he put forth information about things like current plagues and famines that I had no idea about, depressing in themselves and the lack of our media coverage/regard for them. Although he does point out that the most severe consequences of our actions will occur after our generation has left this planet, I fear for our future children and hope that we do not have to put this burden on them.

<p>
After each section, I found myself more and more surprised. This was in part because of my realization of how much of the information I was totally unaware of before, and also because the figures themselves were so alarming. I appreciated how the article took a look at the big picture concerning climate change, discussing multiple consequences that we will be facing due to it, while also keeping everything nice and organized. The issues were explained very well, and walking away from the article, I felt like I had a better understanding of the urgency of this global crisis. In "The Uninhabitable Earth", David Wallace-Wells really made it clear that he did his research and got his information from the scientific experts. I would recommend the article to anyone, because I think a clearer understanding of the severity of this issue is what the world needs right now.



</p><hr>

<p>
"The Uninhabitable Earth," by David Wallace-Wells, was jarring to say the least. I previously thought that I understood the climate crisis fairly well but after reading the article I found that the reality of the situation is much more severe than I thought. 
            <br><br>
The concepts of the air becoming unbreathable and the increase in extreme weather coupled with sea-level rise is terrifying on a cinematic scale. It is inconceivable that despite the already apparent increase in these symptoms of climate change that more steps have not been taken to halt the process. 
            <br><br>
I believe Wells is right to approach the issue with an alarmist viewpoint because in the absence of alarmism, nothing has been done about it.



</p><hr>

<p>
Before reading David Wallace-Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", I believed it was just going to be like any other 'Global Climate Change' article that recycles the same ideas. Yes, global climate change is an increasing problem and if we all don't do something now there will be irreversible consequences. After reading Wallace-Wells' article I was truthfully at a loss for words. I had no idea of the extensive effects that global climate change has already had on our planet nevermind the possibility of what can occur in the future if we do nothing. Although my initial reaction from reading this article was terror, I was inspired to read more about climate change and it's possible solutions.

            <br><br>

The consequence that caught my attention was that of 'Unbreathable air'. Wallace-wells mentions that global climate change may increase the rate of drought in areas like rainforests thus increasing the chances of wildfires. It seems that recent events have confirmed what he proposed. This past summer the Amazon rain forest was rampant with wildfire and currently, Australia is also suffering from wildfires. This is depressing because it is evident that few preventative actions are being taken to stop the climate crisis.
            <br><br>


Indeed, Wallace-wells has an alarmist tone but I do not believe that is a negative thing. He is simply foreshadowing possible catastrophic events such as the deadly increase in global temperature, the decline of efficiency regarding our food production to climate change and the perpetual war that it might bring, only if there is no aggressive action is taken. People, like myself, needed a wake-up call. Through his tone, Wallace-wells frightens the reader into action or at least raises their awareness of this issue.

<p>
While reading Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I found it to be a very grim vision of the future, but not a particularly surprising one. I have definitely learned about and/or read about most of the fears he brought up. However, there was one that I hadn’t heard about that I found very interesting, shocking, and frightening — climate plagues. The climate plagues section explains how there are viruses trapped in arctic ice that, if melted, could be released and infections to humans and animals. Our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back against these diseases, and could have the potential to kill millions. This caught my attention not only because I had never heard of it before, but also because diseases are certainly no the consequences we think of when we think about the dangers of climate change.

            <br><br>

In terms of the tone of the article, I do think that it walks a fine line between being a call to action, and striking so much fear that the reader begins to feel like all hope is lost already so there’s no point in trying to prevent it. In the end however, I do think it leans more towards the latter. The article gives detailed descriptions of how doomed the planet is, but at no point suggests real ways that the average person can help. I understand that that may be because to an extent, there isn’t much we can do about it, but when discussing climate change we must always do so through the lense of how each of us can make a difference. Part of the reason that I signed up for this class was because the title added “what each of us can do about it.” This is essentially for keeping people involved in the conversation.

I agree with your feeling that Wallace-Wells’ article can be so alarming as to paralyse one into inaction, which I have to assume is the opposite of his intention. However, it’s striking that “The Uninhabitable Earth” can bring about such a response even though it’s tone is devoid of urgency or intentional negativity - the article is built on research, laced with the simple facts of our current reality. I found myself needing to briefly step away from the article after reading every few sections in order to digest what I’d read, and I imagine many readers not expecting such a dense reality-check may stop reading all together without reaching the end. I do however think there is a time and place for articles such as “The Uninhabitable Earth.” The piece is a concise and comprehensive crash-course for those who need education on the current state of the climate crisis - especially those who weren’t sure why it’s called a “crisis” at all. 
            <br><br>


I was intrigued by the portion of the article that discussed James Hansen’s term “scientific reticence.” It refers to the way in which climatologists feel that they must hold back when writing about or presenting their findings in order to maintain professionalism and to preserve the reputation of their work, when in reality, the research deserves a response of urgency and alarm. I believe that James Hansen would love “The Uninhabitable Earth,” and the way it refuses to compromise on urgency in order to make readers more comfortable. In the section you address for example, “Climate Plagues,” Wallace-Wells mentions that experts insist that ancient diseases require perfect lab conditions in order to survive being thawed, which may ease the minds of many, but he reveals that many people have already been harmed by anthrax released from melting permafrost in present-day. This response to “scientific reticence” may be exactly what those still on the fence about the severity of the climate crisis need to hear.

Before I began english23, I thought I had knows quite a few things about climate change or climate crisis by the well known word--'global warming.' However, after read "The Uninhabitable Earth," I was kind of shocked by the predicted consequences of climate problem. The whole world is composed by ten billions of people, so every small action would form into an inevitable outcomes. According to the passage, many countries made an agreement about rising below 2 Celsius. Even though 2 Celsius is not huge number, but it will be impossible to be reached without cutting the primary greenhouse production as soon as they can. In order to persuade more people climate crisis is not a fake nightmare, David indicates that the consequences he has expected is just the basement of what will happen instead of being an alarmist. Moreover, the most shock thing is the hurricane in Santa Barbara. As we all know, Santa Barbara is a Mediterranean climate city which means storms and hurricanes are not easy to happen. In my opinion, even though this storm did not actually come, but it still tells us everything is possible to happened under the severe climate problem.

<p>
In David Wallace-Wells’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, he introduces one of the many futures that are to come due to climate change. From the start, he addresses that the way we are heading will take us into our own destruction, into our own doomsday. He shocks the reader with a dark future in order to cause the audience to take action. Wallace-Wells took the approach he did, not to make the reader fearful but aware of the issue. As he mentions in the article there are too many sides and arguments that the message of climate change is not reaching others. He attended the article to be direct and bring awareness of the issue in the hope that we take action. So, his alarmist approach is valid because the issue of climate change is severe and should be straight to the point that we must change our habits in order to achieve a better future.

</p><hr>

<p>
In his article "The Uninhabitable Earth", David Wallace-Wells emphasizes the danger the climate is in and the immediate need for action to slow down and even possibly stop climate change. Before I read this article, I believed I had a reasonable understanding of climate change and the danger we were in. However, Wallace-Wells showed me that we are in much more danger than we thought and that it is necessary for us to act on it immediately.

            <br><br>

One of the sections Wallace-Wells wrote about was the Climate Plagues and Poisoned Oceans. I learned about ancient diseases trapped underneath and in ice for millions of years, and as the earth keeps warming up and the ice starts melting, these trapped diseases could once again be released into the world and create devastating epidemics since we have not been exposed to them for millions of years. The consequences could be amplified because people nowadays are frequently traveling around the world, which would lead to the disease spreading extremely quickly. I feel that large corporations have downplayed this crisis so that their own businesses that rely on burning fossils and producing greenhouse gases could prosper. In addition, marine life is greatly affected because oceans absorb significant amounts of carbon in the atmosphere. The ocean makes up most of Earth, and many people survive and even create a living off marine life. As the ocean increases in acidity, the food could become more dangerous to eat, which heavily impacts much of the population. Coral reefs, which holds marine life that annually supplies about five hundred million people with food, is dying off due to the increased carbon in the oceans. This decrease in marine life, paired with the dramatically increasing population, is dangerous to our food supply and means of surviving on this earth.

            <br><br>

After reading this article, I think Wallace-Wells is slightly exaggerating, but mostly speaking the truth. If he stated that the planet wasn’t in that much danger, then people would wait to take action since they wouldn’t deem immediate action necessary. By persuading his audience using fear, Wallace-Wells effectively communicates the detrimental future regarding climate change, the destructive impact on the earth, and our need to immediately start fixing this problem of the climate crisis. I am convinced that our planet is in great danger due to climate change and that we all should start taking steps to mitigate, and eventually nullify, climate change.



</p><hr>

<p>
Metaphorically, the climate crisis is shaped like an iceberg, where the peak represents the general and repetitive issues about climate change broadcasted in news networks reporting on the rising sea levels. However, underneath the water lies a massive body of ice, not visible at first glance, this represents the predicted chaos that climate change will cause on our planet if not dealt with urgency and discipline. These natural disasters may range from level six hurricane, massive wildfires, to record high temperatures, which will all contribute to the geographical altering of the world we know as of today. 
            <br><br>

Why is it than a large percentage of the population not seeking to impose change in order to mediate and prevent such catastrophic events from happening? Wallace-Wells asserts that the imminent danger of our climate crisis is underplayed. The root of the problem lies within the people; the people deny and thus dismantle all credibility that climate change is indeed occurring. Their denial stems from a threat to their lifestyle. The United States’s culture is based on abundance, that being of food, luxury goods, or wealth. The source of abundance is dependent on the industrial capitalism, which is run by fossil fuel. Therefore, the government as well as the people benefit from underplaying the severity of our situation as it excludes global warming from being a real and tangible issue. 
            <br><br>

Unfortunately, if we continue with the approach of denial, we will become stagnant resulting in no significant environmental progress, by that point we should expect and prepare for the worst of situations. Wallace-Wells list a number of plausible events which might occur depending on several variables. The list includes the rebirth of old diseases that mankind has not encountered in decades, the poor air conditions that if inhaled will cause medical problems, ocean contamination with carbon dioxide, droughts and floods that will destroy agriculture leading to a food shortage and mass starvation, as a domino affect the food storage will contribute to the economic collapse, and public violence. 
            <br><br>

 In order to prevent these events from spiraling out of control, Wallace-Wells insist that we have to impose “aggressive action” immediately to stop the climate change. Personally, I have a pessimistic outlook in our current environmental situation, and after reading the article it did not give me much hope for our future. Although, people are capable of changing their lifestyle to be more environmentally conscience, they lack the incentive to do so.This is truly unfortunate because climate change is happening and has been happening for decades, yet there is an ongoing debate about the reality and severity of climate change. Third world countries, on the other hand, know for a fact that climate change is happening because their livelihood is currently being threatened by it. Therefore, I believe that the United States will not change until a mass destruction directly affects them. Until then, I am afraid that people will continue to ignore the warning signs because they fool themselves into believing that the climate change will never affect them.

In "The Uninhabitable Earth", David Wallace Wells takes on an alarmist approach to the issue of climate change by proposing a list of highly possible outcomes that could occur if we don't take drastic measures soon. While I understand that his goal was to frighten his audience into taking the matter seriously, I believe his choice in taking an alarmist approach had some consequences.
            <br><br>

I personally felt very hopeless and unmotivated when reading this article -- I wasn't startled into action, I was just overwhelmed. However, the way he used evidence to support his ideas did convince me that the climate crisis was not something to be taken lightly. 
            <br><br>

The consequence that I found most worrisome was poisoned oceans, since oceans are becoming increasingly acidic due to it absorbing carbon dioxide from the air. Over 90% of heat from climate change has been absorbed by our oceans. This is having detrimental effects for species such as coral reefs, kelp forests, and sea turtles. The most urgent of these being coral reefs, the loss of this ancient species will have profound implications on our entire ecosystem.

<p>
While I understand how David Wallace-Wells' writing style and approach can be interpreted as alarmist, I read it as blunt and realistic. The ways that this article can feel alarming may highlight both how unbelievable the climate crisis is and also our general ignorance of its realities. I appreciated the directness of his approach and, coming from a credible source, it may be essential for communicating this insane potential future to a general public that is unaware or resistant. The separation of the issue into parts made the information easier to navigate and digest. In the first part, the comparison of this time to our planet's past extinctions set the issue up well and put it in context. Before reading this article I understood more about the less direct effects of heat on humans, not so much about how our bodies physically can't handle these increases in temperature. The information about diseases particularly scares me, especially because we are very familiar with the devastation of disease. While the concept of sea level rise or worse storms can be more difficult to imagine, especially when we feel like they won't touch us, disease could affect everyone.  While heat will spread and worsen diseases we are already combatting, we will progressively be exposed to diseases that we haven't seen in a long time or even have no experience with. The labeling of the government's lack of action as an "absurd business calculation" is a reminder, like the "money talks" comment from "An Inconvenient Sequel," of the many reasons to care about climate change and also of potential economic devestation as a result of climate change. I found the repetition of "by the end of the century" helpful because it put the information he was presenting in the same context. I thought all week about The Great Filter theory, or the concept that an industrialized civilization has a natural lifespan. While just a theory, I think it makes a lot of sense that humans' natural desire to improve, and maybe also our tendency toward selfishness, would repeatedly lead us down this path. Even now, with so much evidence, we ignore as a society and as a democracy this issue. It provokes thinking about how we have gotten here and whether or not there is a scenario where we would avoid this or truly solve it.

The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was very interesting. In the video you asked a question about the article being too alarmist, it was alarmist but not in an over the top way, more of a prominent recap of the dangers that are present and should be acknowledged on our Earth. The article got to the point while interacting with all audiences. any class or any person could read this article and feel as if it applied to their lives and apply it to themselves. 

            <br><br>

While analyzing the article I came across a section where Wallace says at one point that," we are unable to comprehend its scope," refering to climate change of course, which makes me believe that his article serves as a warning and that we all should be completely shocked by the things that we read. The writer uses this article to awaken the reader and inform them. Wallace touches on things that not only describe the way our planet is being hurt but he mentions the way we will slowly fall with it. I think wallace mentioning the end to food makes a lot of people realize that our population could so easily die out. He plays it out alomost like an apocoliptic movie, no food, poisened seas, plauge, war, ect. which is basiclaly every end of the world movie made. Wallace using facts to back up an idea that we thought was fictional, in my opinion, could really wcare some people. 

            <br><br>

Overall the article seamed impactful and delivered its message clearly. He ties up the end of the article with a question, " why cant we see it?" which is very dramatic and adds a nicetouch to his line mentioned earlier in the comment. Wallace gets people thinking and then poses a question asking the reader why society is so blind, this makes the reader leave the article wondering and asking questions which is i think exactly what wallace was aiming for.

Before reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I was genuinely nervous of what I would learn and discover. I have been well aware of climate change and that its impacts are major, but I was never one to want to know the details because it truly scares me. Wells’ alarmist approach to exposing readers of the future of our planet without serious action initially did invoke fear in me. It made me wonder if I would even have the opportunity to live out the rest of my life. I fully understand that there are solutions and the information was given in a very straightforward way, but that did not make me feel any better or any less fearful. However, I do think that these consequences need to be said and people need to listen if we have any chance at making progress.
            <br><br>


 I feel more informed on potential consequences other than warming of the Earth and sea level rise, such as social and economic effects and unbreathable air. I would not have learned this information if it were not for having this assignment. Again, it does scare me straight, but I appreciate that I know more about real potential consequences. The one that compelled me the most were exposure to ancient diseases and plagues that humans have never come in contact with. This made me realize that there are so many more just as serious and threatening consequences than just drastic weather and geographical changes. It was something I did not expect to read and made me wonder how much more I, or even scientists studying the crisis, still do not know. Overall, I found the article an informative read and would urge others to read it as a way to face the realities of the climate crisis.

Throughout the article, I too found myself interested in the climate plagues! In the past, I have thought about the consequences of climate change, but it never occurred to me that the along with the rising temperatures and worsening weather conditions, the melting of ice could cause diseases and plagues from millions of years ago to be released. 

            <br><br>

I agree with you that in order to make a change, everyone must know the full effects that our actions have on the climate. As ugly as the truth may be, proper and effective solutions can only be brought about if we truly know the crisis we are facing. I think that Wells' alarmist approach is effective because it makes his readers think about their actions, and helps them realize that we will be the cause of our own downfall if we keep ignoring the problem and do not attempt to make a change.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells is the wake up call that many of us need. I believe most people in my generation know that climate change is occurring, they know that change needs to take place, they know that we aren’t doing enough, but we do not have a clear idea of what our future holds. This article walks the reader through many of the changes we can expect to see in our lifetimes if things keep happening the way they do. As someone who lives on the coast, Wallace-Wells discussion of sea level rise makes me curious what would happen to towns like Isla Vista and schools like UCSB. 
            <br><br>


Although, Wallace-Wells did take an alarmist position and make me scared for the future I respect him for taking that stance. Media tends to sugarcoat climate change and many people do not have a clear cut idea of the actual trouble that our planet is in. If reading this article saddened you it just further proves that we need to make an effort to make sure that the future that Wallace-Wells speaks about does not happen.

This article was definitely a wake-up call for me. Before I read this article, I knew that climate change was happening and that there were consequences, however, I did not know the true extent of the damage we are doing to our planet. The article, even though it sounds extreme, is backed up by many scientific research and papers on this topic. The undesirable future he lays out in his article are not predictions, but the imminent future if we do not do anything to stop the global temperatures from increasing. I am now more aware of the dangers of climate change and will take steps in changing some of my aspects of life in order to do my share in combating climate change.
            <br><br>
I agree with you when you say that Wallace-Wells takes a necessary alarmist approach to the topic of climate change. Like you said, the media does tend to sugarcoat climate change and I myself did not know how dangerous climate change could be. I believe that everyone should read the article and be aware of the worst case scenario in order to prevent it from happening.

Wells definitely takes an alarmist approach in his article. While painting such a gruesome picture may risk alienating people such as climate change deniers, it fits well into the overall discussion about climate change. Wells points out how obscure and intangible the dangers of climate change are in Section IX: The Great Filter. He notes that nobody will remember where they were or what they were doing when CO2 hits 400 ppm, compared to an event like 9/11 which most people remember vividly. In our society, climate change is definitely a well-known issue but often takes a backseat to other, more immediate threats, such as the potential war with Iran we saw last week. Because there is little real alarm and action being taken on a national level, I think this article offers a good perspective and helps take the abstractness out of the topic by offering concrete examples that make a lot of sense. An issue that particularly resonated with me is that of climate plagues. While nobody living today has experienced a plague firsthand, most children learn about the devastation of the Bubonic Plague in elementary school. Learning that a disease that wreaked havoc on Medieval Europe could be brought back in a matter of years is terrifying and shocking enough to get most people's attention.

This article initially did make me feel hopeless about our planet's survival. I thought that perhaps the best thing for me to do is buy real estate in Alaska or Sweden to escape the heat wave when it hits California. However, after hearing rebuttals I haven't lost all faith in Earth's survival. There are many possible ways we can escape our fate, and the article is at many times a worst case scenario. Overall, it does a great job of being a part of the climate change conversation. It provides an alarmist, but heavily scientifically supported view that keeps the dangers of climate change on the reader's mind after reading it.

In the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, by David Wallace-Wells, the world is introduced to a grim reality. Climate change, and our inability to successfully react to it, will bring Earth to a sixth mass extinction. Wallace-Well’s words are brutal and honest, earning him a title of alarmist due to his ability to scare readers into action. However, being an alarmist can backfire, with people being consumed with fear and losing mental and physical capabilities to rise into action. Life as we know it has been changing all around us, every year seems to bring more and more bad discoveries into the news headlines. Then why aren’t we acting? Wallace-Wells attempts to show the reason why we should act and why we have to act now. Gone are the estimations of a global temperature rising to 1.5 degrees celsius, we are now looking at a much more dire prospect of what can and will happen if we do not change our methods of living, an average closer to 2-4 degrees celsius. As said earlier, Wallace-Wells can be classified as an alarmist but I believe that this idea is a little strayed. While his words can cause fear and panic in readers, they are meant to inspire action more than to terrify. These numbers and statistics are terrifying but what's even more terrifying is the world’s leaders' inability to act. 
            <br><br>
David Wallace-Wells makes a compelling argument. He wants change and he adequately sets himself up to get that change with his article. From a personal view, his article was honest and I admired that. In a world where it seems like everyone beats around the bush, Wallace-Wells is straight to the point and determined to have his voice heard. He is clear to the fact that the earth is dying and that we are at fault for it. Thus, it is up to us as the primary abusers of mother earth to be the same ones who must take care of her. Wallace-Wells created a sound article that presented the truthful fashion of the epidemic that is climate change.

Global warming has never been just talked, it is happening practically beside each of us. More or less, we will feel in our lives: "This year is hotter than last year!" Maybe this is only a complaint about a certain day, but maybe it is also true. Experts have proven that global warming is growing at about 2 degrees per year due to rising carbon emissions. As the sea level rises, experts predict that the Maldives will be submerged in the coming decades; Arctic glaciers are melting and ground-level ice is decreasing. These are not alarmists, but they are actually happening. It turns out that except for the extinction of dinosaurs, the remaining four extinctions were caused by global warming, which is enough to arouse our attention to environmental issues and a sense of crisis.
            <br><br>

The consequences of global warming are not as simple as they seem. It sounds ridiculous now that people have been killed by heat. However, as the temperature rises above 35 degrees in the future, which exceeds the human-suitable temperature, it will be normal for people to be killed by heat. Rising temperatures will also make grains unsuitable for planting and people will fall into famine. In addition, the ancient viruses stored in the Arctic may sweep the earth again, causing a new wave of huge plagues. At the same time, the virus pollutes the air that people depend on, and it also causes a large area of disease and death. This series of cognitions will intensify conflicts and conflicts, which will lead to war and even World War III. With global warming, the ocean will become a "biological killer", the economy will be depressed, a stable life will be broken, and people will lose everything.
            <br><br>

Global warming may really happen to us, but I just feel a little bit about it. Perhaps the articles mentioned are all alarmists of the author. But I think it's better to believe than to scoff at it. Start with the little things around you, go green, reduce carbon emissions, and do our modest job.

David Wallace’s “The Uninhabitable Earth” is a profound read. After my time with Engl 22, I thought I already have a pretty solid comprehension of the issue of climate change. So at first, I didn’t have much enthusiasm to read, but as I proceed into the article, it continues to surprise me. 
            <br><br>

As people argue whether Wallace’s alarmist approach is effective, I would like to point out that at the ending of chapter five, Wallace regarded China’s smog problem as “airpocalypse”. As an international student that comes from Beijing, I lived through the worst years of Beijing, as horrible as the article sounds, the reality isn’t much far off. I would walk back home with my mother, looking at the cones of light the street lamp made. You can see a clear figure of the light being projected on the road as there were so many particles floating in the air. My nose was also giving me a hard time, I could not stop sneezing until my third class every morning. Looking back, I could not imagine what kind of damage my respiratory system sustained. I am glad that the government took responsibility and fixed the air problem in a few years. 
            <br><br>

A few other chapters were also eye-opening for me. What frightens me the most is chapter seven, in which Wallace touched on the degrading economy due to global warming. The chain of events could be devastating. We might be living in a working society for now, sure there are unfortunate conflicts in the middle east, that’s political. But think about when countries going to war to fight for food and resources. How would people and leaders act then?
            <br><br>

This reading further strengthens my view on the climate crisis—it is inevitable. We already made the machine rolling, it's simply too hard to make it stop. What we are doing now is merely preparing for the damage that’s about to come or that already came.

I can relate with you in the sense that my experience in Eng 22 also provided me with valuable information about climate change, but "The Uninhabitable Earth" set fire to a whole new set of devastating realities that are gruesome but necessary to know. I appreciate your firsthand insight on the climate crisis in your life and past city. Drawing from your physical struggles, it is clear that inadequate air quality is damaging health and feelings of wellbeing. While Beijing is a perfect example of climate change impacting standards of living, it is concerning knowing that other more vulnerable countries are currently, and will, follow the same path if serious solutions are not initiated. It is tough because others do not have the economy and financial resources we are privileged with.
            <br><br>

Additionally, I can resonate with your line of thinking regarding our future economy. Once we lose our sense of stability, the structure of society will come crumbling down. In a fight for our lives, civility is thrown out the window. As Wells reveals, "…their median projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning globally by the end of this century (resulting from changes in agriculture, crime, storms, energy, mortality, and labor)". When I really think about it, occupations that rely on the healthy state of our Earth are going to be severely compromised as our planet succumbs under the pressure of climate transformation. Farmers, fishermen, you name it. Where will they go, and how will they adapt in order to achieve survival?

David Wallace-Wells is not too alarmist. His article informs readers about the direction the planet is heading if the temperature continues to rise. However, he does use numerous appeals to fear, listing paragraphs titles, like “Heat Death”, “The End of Food”, “Climate Plagues” follow with statistical evidence like how some places are too hot, people died of dehydration, how food crops will be affected with rising temperature, and diseases from thawing iceberg can cause sickness. I find “ The End of Food” most compelling because Wallace-Wells mentions drought, fertile land,... issues that I can comprehend, rather than terrifying bugs in the Arctic.

After reading the article, The uninhabitable earth, I felt a bit of despair to say the least. The article is comprised of events that will lead to our downfall if we don’t do anything about climate change. The globe’s temperature continuing to increase leads to many consequences such as the melting of ice caps releasing old pathogens and new weather patterns destroying crops and agriculture. These are among the handful consequences mentioned in the article. It is because of this that I feel that the article heavily raises awareness that the planet is ultimately dying. It is a bit extremist, but I think it captures the severity of the issue. As mentioned in the article, climate change isn’t seen as much of a major issue considering its slow, deadly effects. By alarming the audiences, it conveys the idea that this is an issue that everyone in the globe has to tackle at the moment. Thus, from feeling a bit discouraged whilst reading, I think this works for the article in that it mentions we can change the course of events. 
            <br><br>

In doing so, the article does alarm the audiences but does not have specific calls of action. In my opinion, my generation and I, have grown up in a world where it was constantly broadcasted that the planet was dying. The article does the same thing but relays different data. This is good to raise awareness but considering the severity of the issue, I think it is also necessary to include things that one can do to help resolve this issue. Other than that, the article is just alarming and freighting the people so much so that the idea of helping the earth seems a bit unattainable. Thus, I think the article could have used more specific actions that one could do. Disregarding this, the article does inform people of the changes that are about to come and that is also essential but it needs information on how to change those predictions.

Many people are calling David Wallace an alarmist, however after reading “ The Uninhabitable earth”,  Wallace puts it into perspective that dying from starvation, extreme heat, and returning plagues (to name only a few) can be what our future looks like. I thought that this article would be like any other article about climate change where all that is talked about is greenhouse gases, and if we do not lower the amount of greenhouse gases that are being  emitted into the atmosphere, global temperatures are going to rise making the ice bergs in the arctic melt leading to rising sea levels. Wallace has changed the way I think about climate change in fact I have only been exposed to only a very small portion of how climate change can affect our lives. Europe is already being exposed to climate change and its effects, a European heat wave in 2003 had killed as many as 2,000 a day. The temperatures are only going get higher, more people are going to die and because of high temperatures people will not be able to work in the fields to grow crops.  I have never really thought about climate plagues being a danger to the world or that the bubonic plague can return. We are not worried about the effects of climate change because we have not encountered any yet which is really worrying. After reading this article I do not want to live in a chaotic world where people will have to fight for food clothes etc. I would hope that after reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” people realize that climate change is has been happening and will only get worse.

When I first read through Wallace Well's article, "The Uninhabitable Earth," a deep sense of unavoidable doom came over me. Wallace Well's method of writing about climate change made any doom seem impending and unavoidable. He predicts these vast changes that will greatly harm us within my generation's lifetime. He describes endless effects of climate change from an increased rate of infection for dangerous diseases like malaria to an increasingly hostile environment for growing food. He warns us of agricultural disasters by bringing up the devastating American dust bowl and expanding the event to areas where much of our food is produced. I found this particular method very effective as it takes a localized event that the reader likely has some prior knowledge of and enlarging it to much of the world. 

            <br><br>

While this and many other methods that Wells uses may lead people to ignore Well's arguments, I think it is important to understand that Wells does not try to explain what exactly is the most likely scenario and what we must do. Instead it seemed to me that Wells was trying to spur his readers into action by forcing them to realize the possible extent of global warming. Rather than explain a singular possibility he explains a range of possibilities, some of which may not be very likely. By describing scenarios up to the very worst ones, where humanity never takes any action, he leads the reader to conclude that, at some point something must be done, leaving the reader to conclude that it would be better to act now rather than later. While Well's article may alienate hardcore skeptics, it has the greater benefit of motivating to action those who are both apathetic to the situation and believers of climate change.

While I can see how a person would immediately assume David Wallace-Wells is being an alarmist just by his choice of words and tone, I do not think he is one in the slightest. In my opinion, “The Uninhabitable Earth” takes on a necessary approach to climate change because the disastrous effects of it are a very real scenario, and quite frankly, we see a lot of it either happening or beginning to happen now. I viewed his message more as one urging people to take action so that we can avoid the harshest effects of these worst-case scenarios. What’s interesting is that we’re often told to take some type of action, but the only reasons we’re given as to why we should take action is because of melting glaciers and sea-level rise. While those are obviously problems, David Wallace-Wells touches on a variety of effects that we will feel the worst of if action is not taken. I think that his level of seriousness and depth is all necessary for people to take in as it paints a, while depressing, realistic picture of what the future of our home looks like.
            <br><br>


There were two quotes that immediately stood out to me. “Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before, but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow, even by the standards of planetary history.” I found this quote interesting because I think a lot of people who deny climate change have this standpoint where they believe this is just a natural process the Earth must go through and that there is nothing for humans to do about it. I like that Wells discusses how certain parts of the globe will truly be affected by just a seven degree increase in temperature, and it makes me wonder if climate-change skeptics with that view at least try to consider just how hazardous that can be. The other quote is: “the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings;”. The way I see it, scientists choosing to be more cautious means more climate change skeptics having reasons to deny the consequences we are at risk of facing. When they read articles like this, they immediately accuse it of alarmism, even though the facts are planted out right in front of them because they may only be looking at scientists who undermine (or are afraid to state) the true severity of the problem. 
            <br><br>


To be completely honest, it took me a while to finally gather my thoughts with this article because I found myself being pessimistic about climate change a while ago. I kept saying that there’s nothing that can be done so it became less of my concern. This article was a wake up call and made me self-reflect a lot about why I went from being deeply concerned to barely concerned. A lot of it has to do with what I said about only being taught of “surface-level” consequences. Being introduced to this variety of facts and scenarios made me deeply concerned again, and, whether some may like it or not, I think we should all feel that way after reading articles like this or ones similar.

In his article "The Uninhabitable Earth," David Wallace-Wells presents a very interesting and inspiring way of portraying climate issues compared to other climate alarmists. Wells is for sure, a proponent of taking actions to combat climate problems, especially the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, he takes a way that is unusual while powerful than most people. He chooses to present us with a world that is going to be without our immediate and radical changes to our daily business life. Most of the facts and inferences are somewhat scientific and authoritative to make me go along with him. For example, he points out the albedo effect that we all may have learned in high school, which refers to the reflection rates of light with and without ice shields on. He simply turns our speculations learned in high school classes into reality, supported with numbers and data. The ice is starting to melt now and on an unprecedented and dangerous speed that will eventually harness the albedo effect, making the earth even warmer than usual. Whenever this loop starts, it is almost impossible to stop or fix it all because history tells us that it takes time, a quite long period of time, for the planet to fix any changes no matter it is environmental or climate-related. So, I figure our a conclusion here: since we humans have already started the process of climate change and global warming, it is not possible to solve all the problems, even with radical lifestyle change. But, to me, there is still a chance worth try to initiate radical lifestyle change right now because there is still hope. Let me explain.
            <br><br>


All the terrific consequences that Wells presents are not yet here on earth, at least not on a large scale. What I am trying to say here is that there is still a possibility for us not to solve the whole problem but to alleviate it in the case of preserving the planet as best as we can for future generations. The issues or the reasons for previous generations to fail on fixing the climate issues are that one they value too much on economic growth and the convenience of new technologies and two they focus on short-term benefits. The point is we, as the new generations, should stand out bravely to face the problem and should consider for our future generation although our predecessors failed to do that for us. If we are able to think in this way, perhaps the 1.5 degrees Celcius growth will come much later and will not be our schedule but our success; perhaps after another century, we are still able to work in a normal summer day; and perhaps, we can preserve our major cities from floods as 1/3 of them are near the coast. As long as we take consideration for the future but not now, we can re-examine our daily lifestyle and join the climate army as many of the benevolent and moral scientists and predecessors do to save the planet.

<p>
David Wallace-Wells in his article “The Uninhabitable Earth” coveys an alarmist approach and approaches the topic with a grim tone, inducing a lot of anxiety. It is easy to say that I knew the situation of climate change was bad, but hearing the whole scope of it makes me feel very hopeless. His claim that, “even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to comprehend its scope” is a harsh reality. We may scroll through our social media and see a polar bear on broken ice or a frightening headline about the limited time we have to overturn climate change, but sometimes we don’t dare look deeper due to the bliss within ignorance or the anger we have towards billionaires and their lack of investments for our planet and those in power with their missing policy changes or enforcements.
            <br><br>

Though I am glad that he touched upon the aspects of heat death, the end of food, the return of prehistoric plagues, and many other topics, guiding us to how our conditions have deteriorated on earth due to our actions and giving readers a glimpse of how it could be even worse, I feel as though he did not provide enough optimism. There were sections and sections of the circumstances we may endure and his article ended up as a call to fear rather than a call to action to do something to combat these phenomenons from happening. The article ended on a note, claiming scientists have an extent of faith and that we have gone through a frightful event before where there was unanimous belief in destruction, yet after hearing all that is wrong, it was not enough to feel the slightest of hope. 
            <br><br>

And even then, the last paragraph still had worrying statements, such as “the planet is not used to being provoked like this and climate systems designed to give feedback over centuries or millennia prevent us -- even those who may be watching closely -- from fully imagining the damage done already to the planet” and “scientists know that to even meet the Paris goals, by 2050, carbon emissions from energy and industry, which are still rising, will have to fall by half each decade; emissions from land use (deforestation, cow farts, etc.) will have to zero out; and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do.” The latter is specifically terrifying because Wallace-Wells emphasizes a solution that is far-fetched and requires technology that is yet to be invented. Instead of focusing on the discussion of how awful these circumstances are and giving implications that our goals seem so distance, he should have given a more optimistic turn with how readers can proceed to overturn this and especially call out those in power to take action. Wallace-Wells did succeed in receiving a reaction to the negative consequences of climate change, but he did not use this shock and dread to empower readers to do anything after reading. Though it is not absolute all readers would obey any action he could have listed, there would still be the possibility of some inspiration or motivation. With his expertise on the topic, I would expect Wallace-Wells has lifestyle changes to pass on, or have the knowledge of representation to demand policy changes from, or groups of scientists and researchers he recommends to donate to.

For the most part, I agree with your above comment on “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells. First I would like to address the “anxiety-inducing” nature of an alarmist approach that was above mentioned. While I see how this may be concerning and even a deterring factor for some readers, I believe a certain base-level of anxiety is not only helpful to inspiring action but when the scope of the action is as pressing as this is, some level of anxiety is necessary. 
            <br><br>
As for the issue of this approach alienating certain readers, I believe that can be summed up as a risk one must be willing to take when writing an article that truly outlines the scope of a crisis of this caliber. I believe the audience must always be taken into account when analyzing a reading. In this case, I see the audience not as those who deny climate change, as this approach would certainly be alienating to this group, but rather as those that Wallace-Wells defines as “unable to comprehend [the climate crisis’] scope”. This quote as mentioned in your comment above perfectly describes the group that this paper was written for. I believe this article was written in order to strengthen and build a coalition of readers that are already worried about climate change. For me, as a member of this aforementioned group, and article like this induces that exact level of anxiety that I mentioned before, the level necessary to inspire action.
            <br><br>
Finally, the constructive criticism outlined in the above comment is I believe a very effective one for inciting change from the aforementioned audience. By including a series of ideas for what actions could be taken, Wallace-Wells could have eliminated the risk of readers feeling hopeless, rather than inspired to change, after reading this article.

In my opinion, David Wallace-Wells was not being “too alarmist” when talking about the climate crisis in his article “The Unhabitable Earth.” David Wallace-Wells was simply stating what will happen if we humans do not make a change quickly. He would not be doing a very good job if, in his article, he did not tell us everything that he knew and felt. David Wallace-Wells did a great job of explaining things that the average person may not have known about. Personally, I did not consider the fact that the melting ice and permafrost would lead to diseases that the human race has not dealt with before. In addition, I did not consider the fact that the Arctic permafrost has high levels of methane in it, that of which would be released into the atmosphere. David Wallace-Wells did an excellent job of explaining how the Earth is being mistreated, and if our actions do not change soon, the future of the Earth is looking grim.

<p>
In the “ The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells I was surprised  because of the extent of how bad climate crisis is described throughout the article by painting a grim prospective future. It seemed to demonstrate the terrible path we are headed to at the fast pace. It definitely feels very “ doomsday” with the notion that many parts of the world would not be viable anymore and that a large number of the population would die. I had heard previously in my economics class that human population would exceed the amount of food production, but the article breaks it down in explaining the decline of food production and makes it the situation more real. I was not aware of the fact that diseases were trapped in ice and the ice melting because of global warming could release them. It is already worrisome the idea that millions of people could starve or die from related natural disasters fueled by global warming, but an epidemic to diseases we do not have vaccines for is unimaginable. The scenario of violence increasing as resources becomes limited does seem more realistc to currenyt times because of the history taught in classes of countries going to war for claim to land and its resources.
             <br><br>
David Wallace-Wells definitely gets across the urgency of the climate crisis at hand by providing the readers with many negative scenarios that could become a reality if we do not act soon. As for him being an alarmist, I think he does push for trying to scare or worry people into action. I do not think he wants to completely terrify his audience, but he wants to express the urgency of the matter of the climate crisis, which most countries are being very passive about. After reading the article I wanted to learn more about what is being currently done to act against the climate crisis and to see if anything is being done at all. I do not think the articles purpose to make its audience feel helpless and push to inaction, but trying to inform them what possible consequences could come from inaction. I think the article makes a compelling argument, even if a bit excessive it does provide the information needed to get the audience thinking about the climate crisis.

<p>
In reading David Wallace’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth” I immediately felt anxious. The article did a superb job in expressing the dangers of climate change, specifically referring to what would happen if the global temperatures increased by 2-4 degrees celsius. This article simply made me cognizant of the future problems of our world. With terrifying facts that talked about dangers on all fronts. From rising sea levels, unbreathable air, disease, social tensions, natural disasters and so much more. Wallace makes it a point that the earth is approaching unpresedented danger. Wallace undoubtably tried to “frighten us into action.” Some people may find this article to be more on the extremest side, and even if that was true, I don’t think it necessarily has many negative impacts in doing so, besides striking the reader with  much needed shock and fear.
             <br><br>

Moreover, continuing on the severity of the climate crisis, the article takes a very serious approach towards the subject. Not only is the content of the article heavily supported with statistics and facts, the tone, style, diction and syntax of the article all drive the reader to express emotions of fear and doubt. For instance,  “1.8 trillion tons of carbon” are expected to be released upon Arctic permafrost melting. That statement alone raises the awareness of the reader in regards to climate change.
             <br><br>

All in all, the article was an interesting read. The article was well thought out, covered many different topics, and was effective in conveying not only information but also emotion to the reader. I would most definitely recommend this article to everyone.

<p>
The article "The Uninhabitable Earth" is written by David Wallace-Wells to alarm his readers that global warming in fact is a larger problem for us than we can image. The author specifically points out that we are not warned enough of the consequence of global warming effects and he lists three reasons of why: "scientific reticence", technocrats who believe technology can solve every problems, and climate denialism. This is a very professional article including interviews and exchanges of specialists, thus worth to read if you are a member who concern about the earth's future. 
             <br><br>

Some of the examples provided by Wells really do shock me. Before taking this course and read this article, I have never consider global warming as such a "catastrophic" matter --- I know it is serious and it is going to lead to problems, but not this soon and this horrible. As Wells suggests that Miami and Bangladesh are going to disappear within this century, which means there is a huge probability that we are going to witness the death of those pretty places, and what's more is, we are responsible for part of it. 
             <br><br>

I personally do not focus or concern a lot on issues of global warming, but I believe after reading this article, all readers including me will take some reactions to prevent this beautiful earth from being an "uninhabitable" place. Hopefully the result will not be as dramatic as the author says, but  the article itself definitely will motivate us to protect the earth from the effects of global warming.

In the article of “The Uninhabitable Earth”, David Wallace perceptively captures the concern regarding the climate crisis and addresses it with subsequent consequences such as heat death, starving, and perpetual war. He brings out the fierce idea of “doomsday” in the introductory part and illustrates the claim that if humanity doesn’t interfere with the contemporary situation, the end of the world will arrive in near future. There have been five mass extinction along with human history, and if we don’t take a humanity approach soon, the sixth extinction will come along. Throughout the passage, Wallace keeps emphasizing the paramount significance of environmental-friendly living style to raise citizens’ awareness on global worming and contextualize the scary possibilities such as shortened life span and spreading diseases. I was most intrigued by the idea of unbreathable air and heat death.
             <br><br>
Air quality plays an essential in almost every living being’s life. Without clean air, our immunization system gets invaded and we become more likely to suffer respiratory problems which prevent us from staying healthy and hygiene. The article suggests other sequences like decline in human cognitive ability and devastating effects for women in pregnancy. It reminds me of two vivid real-life examples: the Australia forest fire and the China APEC Blue. The Australian bushfire season is of notable intensity this year as the severe fire is terminating lives of millions of koala. This root cause of this catastrophic fire is the air quality and it successfully makes an alarm to people all around the world. While  China APEC blue here seems to take a positive approach on controlling quality of air even though it comes at a price. It’s an act in smog-prone northern China where the local government imposes policies on heavy polluters and limits the number of private cars based on their license plates. The blue skies appeared during the two week gathering of world leaders during the APEC conference but vanished as soon as the meeting came to the end.
             <br><br>
Wallace concludes the article by suggesting civilization and future generations. He reinforces that scientists still don’t entirely understand what happened, or what they missed, needless to say that normal individuals are far less aware of the current disastrous planet. While it’s our responsibility to change this environmental tragic and make it a habitable place for all the living beings.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I do not think that Wallace-Wells was too alarmist. He merely states the obvious and is straightforward with his opinions on what will happen to the Earth if nothing is done. He does not try to sugarcoat things, nor does he offer the people a false sense of hope for a better future. By presenting the future in such a bleak manner, he is trying to urge the public into action and prevent what he described in the article from becoming our reality before it is too late. While I do believe that Wallace-Wells has reasonable concerns for the future of our planet, his views may have the unintended effects of paralyzing people with fear. If people believe that the future of our planet has already been decided, and nothing they do will change the outcome, people will not bother changing their ways. 
             <br><br>

There are still many people who deny the existence of climate change and refuse to believe that humankind and our actions can change the climate. The idea that people do not believe in climate change is unfathomable to me because there are numerous amounts of scientific evidence out there that the public can easily access. 
             <br><br>

As an ES major, none of what Wallace-Wells mentioned in his article came as a surprise to me. If we continue with the way things are, our planet is doomed. Even if we do change our ways, there are some things that are bound to happen and impossible to save because it is too late. However, this should not deter people from trying to save the planet, regardless of how hopeless it may seem. We have a responsibility to fix the problem that we caused and ensure that there is an Earth for the future generations.

In the reading “The Uninhabitable Earth”, David Wallace-Wells introduces how global warming is induced and how the climate change, namely global warming, makes the earth uninhabitable. He puts forward several specific problems we are facing under global warming, which are human and mammals in the circumstances of higher temperature, shortage of food production, climate plagues, unbreathable air, drought which would contribute to civil war, as well as the poisoned oceans.Through describing these with specific examples, Well sets an alarm to the severe situation and to draw people’s attention to the problem of global warming.

What would you think is the most severe problem out of the ones you just mentioned? And Why?

David Wallace-Wells' article "The Uninhabitable Earth" approaches the issue of climate change in a quite negative way. While I can certainly agree that climate change is a pressing issue, I found Wells' discourse on the topic to be that of one who simply complains. His article is essentially a very long list of his opinions of interviews he has conducted with climate experts. Those opinions also tend to require a lot of assumptions to hold true. Whether it be my belief in science or simple logic, I tend to be skeptical of thinking that requires one leap to certain conclusions in order to form a final opinion. At one point in Wells' article he notes "11 or 12 degrees of warming" and uses that point to again scare the reader about the most extreme effects of climate change assuming our society does nothing to address the problem. In all fairness to Wells, he does mention that many of the extremes in his article do assume no action on our part, I think it would have been more realistic for him to write an article with slightly more conservative predictions considering that zero action from our society is highly unlikely. I also believe that if Wells' truly wanted to paint a full picture about climate change, he should address some solutions to this problem. At the very least, Wells could acknowledge some validity in the hope that he stated some of the climate experts he interviewed provided. Instead, Wells calls them "optimists." It seems a bit hypocritical to me to use part of their opinions to support his claims and simply dismiss other parts of what they told him. As I stated earlier, Wells just wrote a long list of the most extreme results of climate change but he doesn't address any ways in which our society can do something to solve the problem. This is why I won't even call Wells an alarmist. Most alarmists, in my experience, also tend to shove solutions in your face when they talk about the imminent crisis that they are so passionate about. Wells basically says we're all screwed and doesn't tell us how we can avoid being screwed. While I do agree with the importance Wells places on the issue of climate change, I simply can't get behind his extreme analysis and failure to provide, or even agree on the existence, of some hope regarding solving the issue.

After reading “An Inhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I’ve come to the conclusion that pessimism over climate change is necessary to a degree, and should rightfully have a strong, urgent tone. While Wells’ alarmist perspective on climate change may give skeptics more of a reason to scoff, the article points out the negative effects of climate change that one would not even think of. Many deniers hold their opinion because they cannot see the day-to-day, direct effect climate change has on them. However, in as little as a couple decades, there will be dire consequences to people’s health and well being. For instance, a 70% smog increase by the middle of this century would have massive consequences on the air quality and health of every person on this planet. In addition, there are numerous positive feedback loops that will output even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If the gelisols in the arctic melt then there will be a release of CO2 far greater than anything we have imagined. The general population understands that there is an excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but do not grasp the gravity of the situation or that there is far more in store for humankind. If a skeptic were to read this article, I feel as though they would catch themselves surprised at the effects of climate change, and see how this dire situation is interconnected with the whole globe.
             <br><br>
Now if a person who doesn’t have an opinion on climate change were to read this alarmist perspective, the question remains: would this “bum them out”? And I personally believe that instead of someone feeling depressed when reading Wallace’s, they would feel a political spark and want to take action. I believe that people are in denial about climate when there is blame placed onto them, but they're almost all of the effects of climate change are caused by a small handful of corporations. This, in turn, makes people enraged, and wonder if they can do anything personally. In conclusion, Well’s alarmist perspective may seem over-exaggerated on a surface level, but with this article comes the tangible effects of climate change that naysayers refuse to see. While feelings of doom may come to a reader after finishing this piece, I believe it will light the fire that the general population needs, before these catastrophes become a reality.

I am particularly interested in the second section of the article “Heat Death -The bargaining of New York”. I used to live in the city and the streets would be like hot frying pans during summer. While reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I couldn’t stop imagining what the views near the Tropic region would look like in the next century. Wallace uses vivid descriptions to show how animals suffer from hot weather: “humans, like all mammals, are heat engines”. So if the air is too hot to let the animals cool off, they might just die of their own heat. I think die of heat is just the most painful and torturous way of death for all living beings. 
             <br><br>


The wildlife is more vulnerable to hot weather than us. Humans have multiple ways of fighting against the heat. We have air conditioners, fans, and blinds that keep the sun from coming through the windows, etc. The wildlife, however, has far fewer ways to cool off. They need a natural shade, river or lake( I can’t think of a third method it seems like they only got two options, RIP wildlife). The rising temperature would definitely reduce their ways of living and just as Ken said in the lecture: “the sixth extinction might be already happening”. And  I believe most of the horrible pictures that Wallace portraits are going to be common conditions of the future if we don't take action.

I agree with Ming Gao in the sense that temperature rise as well as the food crisis were one of the most alarming topics from the "The Uninhabitable Earth" article. It is the most vulnerable such as animals and the poor that will suffer more from Climate Change. That is why I find that Wallace-Wells was not too alarmist when he addresses the future possibilities of climate change. These scenarios may not all come to fruition but the very possibility of them happening should instill fear in us and make us act. We have been complicit long enough in the destruction of not the Earth necessarily, but of civilization as we know it. Wallace even mentions in his article that the reason we may not know of other life outside of Earth could be because they exhausted their resources in the same way we are exhausting fossil fuels.
             <br><br>

Wallace Wells painted a very clear picture of the bleak future we face. The fact the US being the second largest polluter backed out of the Paris Agreement is such a dangerous thing because of the large influence it has on other nations. Our oceans are becoming more acidic, temperatures are becoming unbearable and hundreds of thousands of people will be displaced. Where will these people end up? War has already displaced thousands of people and they have not been welcomed warmly into other countries. So what happens when billions of people have to flee due to flooding coastlines, lack of water, and food?
              <br><br>

After watching certain videos or reading certain articles I feel like a lot of us pledge to be more green and help fight climate change but soon after lose interest. I regretfully have done the same thing but choose to act this time. I decided to join the sunrise movement and can hopefully start attending their events. I have been complicit long enough and Climate Change does not wait around.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” uncovered truths about climate change that I had never before known. It first terrified me to learn that when ice melts it not only raises sea levels which has impacts on the surrounding habitats and urban areas, but it also releases CH4 and CO2 which had been captured by the ice, it means that less sunlight can be reflected and is instead absorbed which creates more warming, and it reintroduces diseases that had been trapped from previous centuries back into the air we breathe. I previously knew that climate change was a global problem, but I had no idea how many consequences it had. Towards the middle of the article, I transitioned from feeling alarming fear to feeling pessimistic. This feeling came mostly from the idea that the earths extinctions could be the earth filtering off our population. This made me feel as if this is an inevitable process that we are just living through. This feeling started to subside towards the end of the article when hearing about the optimism of some of the first climate scientists. The idea that these people have spent their lives learning about this and still believe we can make a change gave me some hope. I was also relieved to hear that so many countries agreed to the Paris Accords, but concerned again when Ken mentioned that the US has already removed themselves and that there are no enforcements for participating countries. This made me realize that one of the biggest problems with climate change may be our lack of accountability. Because of the array of responses I felt, I do believe that Wallace-Wells was being alarmist at times. However, I do not believe that an alarming tone is a bad thing, and I am concerned that some people would dismiss these facts because of it. “Frightening people into action” as a plan of motivation may work well for some people, as they want to solve the problems right away, but not for others, as they may become discouraged and give up on the problem. It can be valuable to have different motives incorporated for these differing audience types, and I believe that Wallace-Wells succeeds in doing that throughout his article.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, inspired me more than any other material I have read lately. Towards the beginning, I was most captivated by the idea that Miami and Bangladesh will be nonexistent within the century. I may have done this out of order, but I watched “Before the Flood” first. Before these two assignments, I am ashamed to admit I was completely unaware of the growing crisis taking place in Florida. That fascinates me because it is a tragedy happening within my own country, yet it is not reported on regularly. I was also astonished while reading about the previous mass extinctions that have occurred. As Wells acknowledges, I am one of the teenagers that was only taught about the dinosaurs being taken out by an asteroid. Never had I learned that there were at least 4 other extinctions all caused by greenhouse gases. While promoting the idea that we are next, he finished the paragraph stating that no amount of carbon emission reduction will put a stop to what is about to come. What a depressing way to end! 
              <br><br>

In the End Of Food section, I was most interested when reading about how the draughts are a bigger problem than heat, though it is often referred to as global warming. This fact was interesting because I am from Sacramento and we were recently in a draught. This meant restrictions on sprinklers, and showers etc. I found the draught to be very difficult and ugly for the community. 
              <br><br>

Finally, why we aren’t talking about the horrible diseases stored in the Arctic is beyond me. The ice is melting at a rapid speed but what’s inside is even more alarming. How is the bubonic plague stored in ice? I don’t know but that is a horrible thought. Smallpox is also trapped in the Siberian ice. One way or another climate change will evidently cause the destruction of mankind whether through carbon emissions or through disease!

I completely agree with you! “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells is one of the most moving pieces of environmental literature that I have read so far. When professor Hiltner asked in class how worried I am about climate change I answered pretty worried, however, after reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” I can strongly say that I am petrified of climate change and the consequences we will soon face. I found it extremely captivating and shocking, as well, when Wells scoffs at the idea that people still believe in places such as Florida and Bangladesh surviving. To think that a part of the United States could be underwater and completely taken off the map due to climate change is horrifying. When I think about climate change, my mind goes straight to polar ice caps melting and sea-level rise, but Wells does an amazing job at illustrating a plethora of consequences people, like myself, would have never thought of. I had no idea that Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, which is more than twice as much as is currently in the Earth’s atmosphere. Wells goes on to explain that “when it thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful than any greenhouse-gas.” This is an alarming statistic that has never been brought to my attention in any other documentaries I have watched or environmental literature I have read. Not only can methane be released from the Arctic, but also diseases “that have not circulated in the air for millions of years” can suddenly be released into the air causing major outbreaks and health concerns for all. Another aspect Wells touches on is the occurrence of widespread droughts. Wells explains that “By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China.” That is a number of different places all over the world that will be destroyed through the presence of permanent drought. These are extremely scary scenarios that can happen if we do not change the way we live.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells reflects on climate change and discusses what we can expect from this phenomena. Often times when thinking of climate change, people think of rising sea levels and warmer temperatures. However Wells presents several changes that are rarely discussed. One of his most interesting points is global warming will release old diseases that were thought to be extinct. Trapped in ice, diseases such as the bubonic plague will be reintroduced to society after the ice that encapsulates it melts. 
              <br><br>

This article should alarms its audience. Most people don't understand what the full effect of climate change will look like. Wells does a good job giving the reader insight to the detriments of climate change. This article has a very pessimistic attitude, and for good reason. Climate change is a very serious and scary issue that people don't take serious. Although this article may scare people, I believe everyone should read it because fear is an effective motivation tactic. If more people were better educated, there would be a larger motivation to make a change. While this article's pessimism is effective, it can also be discouraging. My biggest complaint of this article is that it provides no hope. Fear is only a powerful motivation tool if people believe we can change our fate. Wells's article offers no optimism in face of what's to come. In his book "The Cautious Case for Climate Optimism," Wells explains why he is optimistic about the future. I would like to read that book and compare it to his attitude in his "The Uninhabitable Earth" article due to his seemingly hopeless view of the future.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” written by David Wallace-Well, I am impressed by his alarmist tone throughout the article, making me feel like if we don’t take action in climate crisis, the “Doomsday” will come true. In the “Heat death” section, the author illustrates some serious results that might be caused by the increasing temperature, including the ancient diseases trapped by the ice, which will be released due to the melt of Arctic permafrost. These diseases are unknown to us and may lead to a significant impact on our daily life. However, some deniers do not treat the diseases as a problem and believe their lives will keep going without change. Therefore, the author applies the alarmist nature and exaggeration to trigger the action, waking people from their wonderful fantasy about the future, since the fear is the best motivation for human. Besides, the author also predicts the future if the climate crisis hasn’t been solved. The droughts will make the land inhabitable. With such high temperatures, the food can’t grow, and the people must migrate to a cooler area, making the food and land as the scared resource. And this can trigger the drastic competition of people and even the war. This consequence reveals our nature behind humanity, making us know the true cost of our current behavior. It just like the Earth wants us to understand that we destroy ourselves.  
              <br><br>
To this point, many people are still escaping from the climate crisis, since the bad results may not put on the current generation. But we must think of our responsibility. It is not saving the Earth but saving the human ourselves. So, I really hope this alarmist article can wake more people up to face the climate crisis.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells is an unsettling article describing what our world has the potential to look like if we continue global warming at the rate we are. Unfortunately, while the world he describes is what he projects at a global increase of around 3-4 degrees, this might even be a hopeful and generous target for where our global warming ends. With only the Paris Agreement trying to hold countries accountable, having no backing or consequences puts a lot of faith in a few countries who at the end of the day can easily just sau yes to it and not do anything about emmissions. Also with the biggest carbon emitter in the world - the United States -  leaving it, it does not look hopeful that this will inspire countries to keep their emissions down enough to reach the afformationed goal of 1.5-2 degrees that we need to stop enormous sea level rises. 
              <br><br>

However, the article almost fails to be effective in the ways it needed to be. The article needed to inspire change in the average person who reads it, so they become inspired, in turn, to hold their countries leaders accountable for living up to the agreement, and to finally stop this gross global warming. Instead I think the article almost inspires people to give up. It does not promote hope and it does not tell people how they can be the difference we need to see. I think that would be a good addition to the article. Instead, a person who may not be as inclined to go out of their way to research how they can be the difference may close off in a panic that we have already reached this state and we have no way to stop it. I think it is very important that we call attention to the issues we have created, but at the same time I think it is also very important to always call the same attention to how we can turn it around. Following fear with hope and action is a more effective way to create change.

I do not agree that the article needs to be intended to inspire people. Wallace has rightfully chosen a way, a gloomy way, to show the audience that we are running out of time to change the course of our planet. Scientists have tried for many years to inform us about the dangers of climate change from a young age in a polite and nice manner, and we failed to do anything about it. Teachers have taught us too about the importance of our future but they fail to do so, but why? This is mostly do to our parents. Our parents were raised in a time where climate change was not a problem and educate us the same way their parents did. It is about time that someone had the audacity to present our "future schedule." These disasters are not a "could be" but a "will be". It's not that he is trying to petrify us with fear but tell the truth as it is in order for us to react and do something about it. 
              <br><br>
I do agree with your comment on how he did not provide ideas or resources to help us stop this crisis. After all that "negativity" from reading the article, he could've presented ideas to something about our future. Maybe his intention is to make us think and formulate solutions for this problem. After all, he won't be here when things get scarier. Hopefully, we will become aware of the disastrous future we have ahead of us. Nothing that he said is meant to happened. He is not giving us predictions of our future but rather portraying the different realities that we could possibly end up.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, the article itself does contain an overall negative tone that left me feeling angry and upset at the apocalyptic future of unmitigated climate change. While I do believe it is important to draw attention to the deadly future that may await us, doing so in this way incites a petrifying fear that appears to be inescapable. Rather than educating people on how to prevent this horrible future, the writing style Wallace-Wells adopts focuses on the adaptations humans will make to adjust to climate change. His attempt to scare people into action is both valid and effective, but leaves out ways that people can actually take that action. An article in particular should always seek to inform the audience about whatever the subject is, and leaving out the ways in which we can improve our future omits a large part of that topic.
              <br><br>


The purpose in raising awareness should be to let people know what the problem is and the ways in which they can fix it. It will always be important to look towards the future, but in an attempt to do so this article has removed the possibility of a better future. This article does an amazing job at informing people of the possible dangers and the realities of climate change, but it falls short in educating people on how to avoid those dangers.

<br><hr>

I agree with you that Wallace-Wells' article does not inspire readers by showing them how easily they can make a difference, and with a problem as serious as the climate crisis, the reality is one person cannot save the planet alone. If Wallace-Wells chose to trivialize the climate's current status, he may perhaps inspire a few individuals, but he runs the risk of letting a great many more people think that the issue is not as serious as it truly is. However I think that inspiration is not really his direct intention. First and foremost, Wallace-Wells seeks to educate the greater public on the dire nature of the atmosphere's current state; although it is now referred to as a crisis, people often just take the name for granted. Nearly any politician on the national stage at this point in time could list a plethora of issues that they think are more important than climate change right now, and that is an attitude that must change. I think that by showing how severe the consequences can, and will likely, become, Wallace-Wells imbues the phrase "climate crisis" with much more weight. Therefore it is the significance of the problem that is meant to spur readers into action.

After putting down the article by Wallace-Wells I felt called to action. Wallace-Wells undeniably alarms his audience by laying out many consequences I did not realize I would even have to consider fearing for my future. I believe his approach to educating the public on this topic is appropriate and valuable. His urgency is valid and I believe our lawmakers and representatives should hold the same urgency when considering their responsibilities. Reading Wallace-Wells article instilled a feeling of guilt as well as shock. I knew little about the climate crisis prior to reading the article and was alarmed by the countless details that were new to me. The most frightening of them all was when Wallace-Wells stated, “There are now, trapped in Arctic ice, diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases, since before humans were around to encounter them. Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice.” I had heard before that the ice caps were melting and the sea level is rising, but the fact that ancient diseases could be released from global warming was a new concept to me. I respect the thoroughness of Wallace-Wells’s article and his ability to instill fear within his audience. I think the lengthiness of the list and the many consequences he addresses adds to the effectiveness of the article.

I would agree with your  statement that this is more of an alarmist article than otherwise because of the way Wallace Wells talks about the issues that he brings up. He speaks in a tone that is very urging of people to absorb and consider what he is saying instead of just reading it as 'another global warming article.' I think that it was smart of him to have this sense of urgency because it sort of sets an example for how EVERYONE should feel about climate change. Anyone from lawyers, and government officials to friends and family should have a sense of urgency of the extreme state of emergency that we have put our environment at.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” is an article written by David Wallace-Wells. In this article, the author argues that people will reach their “Doomsday” and destroy themselves if there are still no proper, crucial adjustments about their living style which contributed to global warming a lot. (The Uninhabitable Earth) There will be plenty of severe consequences other than the rising of the sea levels, such as “Heat Death”, which means creatures will die because they cannot adapt to the rising of temperature due to the global warming, “Unbreathable Air”, which means that the due to the global warming, the fraction of carbon dioxide contains in the air will increase thus lead to the drop of oxygen, and make the air unbreathable for species, and so on. Although these are all hypothetic right now, without any actions taken to deal with global warming by a human, they will become the reality.

In “Readings, Introduction”, it mentions that some articles such as “Why Scientist Disagree About Global Warming”, they are created to cover the truth of there are plenty of anthropogenic pollutions as well as severe climate crisis, for the purpose of making profits for the fossil fuel market. This really terrifies and surprises me, I can’t believe there are some people who only care about themselves and their interests for the short period, rather than think of the Earth and people as a whole, reducing pollutions and creating a better environment for the future. 
              <br><br>

There is someone may say that David Wallace-Wells is an “alarmist”, and his article “The Uninhabitable Earth” uses aggressive perspectives. In my opinion, these are appropriate and necessary. These days, human has already polluted the Earth and harm the environment a lot, like it is said in the article “The uninhabitable (or at least unwelcoming earth”, “the global temperature has already risen by two thirds that amount [1.5 degrees Celsius] (I degree Celsius from preindustrial levels.)”. Combining with the facts such as “Arctic sea ice cover dropped about 13% this decade” and “The past five years were the hottest ever recorded on the planet”, I don’t think there is any extra time for human to waste before they can take effective actions to deal with the severe climate crisis. By using the seemingly “alarmist approaches”, David Wallace-Wells successfully calls for the actions of people to protect the Earth.

In the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” David Wallace-Wells takes an alarmist approach in a way so that the reader becomes nearly terrified of what is to come. Wells displays a harsh reality that will be in our future with a very pessimistic point of view. This article clearly states all the possible consequences that are to come if no action is taken to fight against the climate crisis. I’m almost positive that Well’s goal of this article was mainly to scare the reader in a way that will make many feel defeated, and rightfully so. As he piles consequence upon consequence in precise detail of what is to come, it can be eye opening to one who does not think about climate change in their day to day life. As terrifying as it is Wells alarmist approach is what is most needed in today’s society considering how bad it already is. Wells said it best about our society today, “But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough.” This quote stuck out to me because many students at UCSB are very well-informed about climate change. Although, I know not everyone is alarmed enough to take immediate action on this crisis because I know I was not, but I am now. 

              <br><br>

David Wallace-Wells successfully made me feel terrified of what can possibly be our future, or our kids' future. I felt the need to take immediate action not necessarily for myself, but more for the people I love. Although completely terrified, I am thankful for this abrupt wake up call because of his alarming claims. Wells bringing up the fact that we are in the midst of our Earth’s sixth mass extinction is something that I hope many people think about thoroughly. His points about less food growth and rising sea levels are consequences most have heard before, but do not see how soon those are to come. According to Wells, the population of the Earth is to reach 10 billion in the next 30 years and with our planet on the decline while population is on the incline is a scary thought to comprehend considering the consequences. Despite the fact that mankind can possibly be doomed very soon if action is not taken, there is still hope if we approach this climate crisis as an alarmist.

While I completely agree that climate change is real and is currently the largest threat to mankind, I disagree with your statement that we need to approach this in an alarmist fashion.  I understand why Wallace-Wells writes an alarmist paper: It is controversial so it will be seen by millions of people, and many of those people would feel a call to action.  I even felt a desire to change my habits and think of ways to improve our environment.  The issue with using alarmist statements is that if they are not realized, such as the bubonic plague being spread due to melted ice, people who are unsure if they believe in climate change will feel as if the scientists are wrong and are lying to them, making them fully disregard climate change.  This is an issue, because these are the people we are trying to convince it is real, and who could make a difference in voting on public policy.  I believe it is more important to provide real examples, such as the seven listed at the end of Ken's video, and using those to demonstrate why climate change is an issue and needs to be fixed.  

              <br><br>


We also need to stop trying to incentivize people through appeals to good-will and start providing economic incentives for  companies, such as Impossible Foods and GE, to continue to produce products that will greatly . reduce our nations carbon footprint.  Companies can only do things that will benefit investors, and currently it is more beneficial to run current oil plants instead of building wind power plants, and it is more cost effective to buy hamburger meat than buying a plant based alternative.

In David Wallace-Wells’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, he illustrates, his point that  well through the whole article. The first one is the environmental problems. caused by the climate changes such as the acceleration of melting of glaciers, the second one is to illustrate that climate change can also cause damages directly to human bodies, most superficially appeared in the form of increase of temperature. Third is the less efficient to grow food as the  increase of temperature... It really provides me with lots of different perspectives to climate change problems. However, as I was thinking and also found it mentioned in the article that the climate change issue has been more than a "environment issue" but also a moral issue. I personally believed that maybe we can not feel or see the effects mentioned in the articles or films made by the environmentalist. However, we can feel the effects on our own and it is right  and not hard for us to live just a little " more greenly".  And we do not want to left our offsprings with a terminally ill earth, and certainly do not want to trigger another extinction because of our selfishness. We do need a better tomorrow w for earth.

The article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” was an interesting article to read and an eye-opener. David Wallace did a sufficient job in terms of sort of scaring me of what can happen in the future if global warming continues at the current rate it is at today. He talked about the worst-case scenarios that come about and end up in a world of drought, plague and famine. It was noted that some people see Wallace as an alarmist but I would not consider him an alarmist. I think Wallace must exaggerate a little and emphasize the possibilities of destruction in order to effectively get this message across to anyone who comes across reading the article. So I think bringing this fear to his audience by reading about these possible destructions if no action is taken will hopefully encourage others to want to participate and create change. 
              <br><br>

One thing that stood out to me while reading was when Wallace stated, “Already more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning.” I cannot believe how harming these fuels has been to thousands of people and it is hard to think about the thousands more that will be affected in the upcoming years if forms of pollution in the air continue to increase. Overall this article made me realize that many people including myself, dismiss the crisis of climate change and there needs to be more action and attention to this critical issue.

After reading the article, I agree with your statements. I think that the article does in fact seem a little alarming and meant to scared the audience. However, I think that at the point that we are now it is in fact necessary to scare society a little bit. The facts are that if we do not change something as society as a whole, those worse case scenarios that David Wallace presents in his article can become a reality. I agree with Analyse saying that it is necessary to exaggerate a little in order to encourage people to really make a change. If people do not believe that this is something that can and will happen and will affect the way they live, they will never make a change.
              <br><br>
Something that really popped out of me when reading the articles is the effect that climate change has on crime rates. I was aware that for most people it is easier to be irritable when the temperature is higher, however I did not believe that it had that big of an impact on actual crime rates. However, I do see the logic that he uses for this since as temperature rises people are more inclined to commit crimes.



    </span></div><hr>
<p>
Before reading “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I was not fully aware of the climate crisis or its enormous effects on the planet. Though others may say that Wallace’s method of approach was farfetched, dramatic, and alarming, I believe that it was more realistic if anything. He instills fear in readers, but in the most brilliant and intense way. His choice of words paints him as an alarmist, but what he’s saying is true and real. It’s a way to really get readers to pay attention instead of spewing out information like most people. Wallace’s methods may also cause people to call climate change a hoax because it could be misconstrued as dramatizing a situation. This may not be the case, however. 
              <br><br>
He stated that the only mass extinction that was not caused by fossil fuels and carbon emissions was that of dinosaurs. I find this to be extremely terrifying becauses emissions are being expended at a faster rate, and making certain species go into extinction. Are we next? It may be likely. 
              <br><br>
In addition to this, plagues that were trapped in the Arctic hundreds of years ago may resurface. So not only does the warming of our planet cause more hurricanes and rising sea levels, but it may extinguish the human race through disease as well. That in itself makes me fear for my own generation as well as future generations.

I think what you said about how Wallace's methods could cause people to think he is exaggerating the situation and therefore think it is a hoax, is a very valid point. Some people, no matter how clearly the facts are stated, continue to ignore the issues at hand. I think Wallace does a good job of talking about overall effects on the planet but also the effects on humans too. For people who don't care about the planet as much as they care about humans, this could really change their perspectives on Climate Change.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells was definitely an eye opening read. Before reading the article, I didn't really see climate change as an "emergency" issue. I did acknowledge that climate change is a real issue but I looked at it more as an issue that would not come to surface for many years to come. The truth is, the damage that has been done by climate change is here now and there is no denying it. There are so many beautiful, clean, and open parts of nature that I've experienced and seen so it was hard to feel the sense of urgency before reading this article. I also was not aware of the "greenhouse effect." But after learning more about climate change as a whole, i'm ready to take action.

              <br><br>

With that in mind, I want to learn more about what I can do to help the climate crisis. What CAN I do? I could become vegetarian to put a hurt on the meat industries, I could vote for politicians that advocate for aggressive action, or I could stop driving to help stop emission of harmful gases. In my opinion, this would only significantly help if we changed peoples ideas and actions. Influencing people to help contribute would certainly help, and should continue practice, but I believe the planet would have a much better shot of survival if we used all of our energies towards producing a technology that could eliminate CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Changing everyday peoples' actions could be a much tougher task than developing a technological fix. I think that we have enough time to accomplish this, and I know that we as humans can accomplish great things/ and adapt to develop a technology capable of doing so. 

              <br><br>

I think there is some truth to calling Wells an "alarmist". He explores the possible disastrous outcomes with a sense of urgency and I believe that he is well aware of the alarming rhetoric and alarming way he portrays the topic of climate change. There's nothing wrong with this. The truth of the matter is that climate change IS an urgent matter, it should be portrayed in an alarming way to capture people's attention.

I totally agree with you. The climate change problem is something that needs to be addressed immediately. Not in a couple of years, not for many decades, but now. Wallace-Wells takes an alarmist approach here because of how dire the possibilities of the situation are, and that there needs to be some sense of urgency if we want to make this world last. When doing this, people become really concerned and look at the seriousness of this issue. Also, I would also want to learn more about what I can do to help. With so many different scary possibilities, I want to get involved and do my part. 
              <br><br>
 Hopefully, after reading this article and learning about the effects of climate change, more people will want to take action and make a significant change.
              <br><br>

On the content and facts of the article, I was surprised and a little depressed when reading the possible outcomes for our beautiful planet. What stood out to me was the decline in food and incline in population during this century. With 50% more humans and 50% less food available by the end of this century, if we as a planet don’t take immediate action, this planet truly will be uninhabitable. In addition, the poisoned oceans section captured my attention. Cities on coasts throughout this century will slowly start to realize the danger they are in with rising sea levels. This is extremely alarming to me, and hopefully to others after reading “The Uninhabitable Earth.” There will be too many disastrous global issues with the current way we live on our planet, and the alarmist attitude is justified for this reason.

After having read the “Uninhabitble Earth” by David Wallace Wells I would in no way call him an alarmist. The fact is that all these disaters he had pointed out are disasters that have been scientifically proven to occur in the future at the current rate climate change is taking us. The New Oxford Dictionary defines an alarmist by a person “who us considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic.” In no way are Wallace Well’s points needless or exaggerated. Not to say that all of these disaters are going to occur for a fact, I have faith that humanity will change its course before it does, but some of these will be consequences if we continue to lack in changing our ways. I believe that Wallace Wells approach can risk in alienating certain readers, however, I wouldn’t have done it anyother way as we have no more time to suger coat the dangers that we are approaching. 
              <br><br>

 This article definently woke me up to the realities that we face globally. These disasters are truly horrifying. The one I find most horrifying is the “heat death”. Heat death is one of the disatster I feel that our science and technology would have the hardest time solving. Also it concerns me most because of the injustice it poses to those who live in less developed coutries and are living in poverty as they wil be most directly affected. Wallace Well’s article is a good wake up call to humanity concerning tghe crisi that we ahve put ouselves in.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace Wells I was super interested to read about what he was going to say. I agree with you that, although Wells has an alarmist sense, he is being real about what will happen if we do not start making a change on how we affect this planet. His in depth details about the events that occur are extremely frightening to me, and I hope others feel that as well. We need to make a difference as to how we treat this planet because if we don’t, the outcomes are catastrophic. For example, Wells states “As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation,” which explains how flies carrying the Zika virus may be able to get to more places because of the hotter temperatures. 
              <br><br>

He scientifically proves that it is impossible to stop the damage we have done. Another example in the text that should frighten people to make a difference, is the fact that Florida and Bangladesh will be flooded because of rising ocean water. It is undeniable that Wells is able to provide enough examples to scare people. This really made me want to start doing something. I even wanna start by doing a meatless day each week. I hope that other people are also inspired to make a difference.
<br><hr>
After reading the article I can say that I absolutely agree with you. Based on this definition, Wallace-Wells in no way is an alarmist. He is only pointing out potential dangers that are backed by scientific evidence. Wallace-wells is not trying to frighten us with a false problem nor is he exaggerating the dangers of climate change. Climate change is a huge problem and every danger mentioned in the article can happen and will happen unless we begin to fix this issue. I understand that by pointing out dangers as extreme and severe as the ones mentioned in the article, some readers may not believe they are truly possible and they will not get into the issue, and of course this is not what climate change activists such as Wallace-Wells want, but I believe Wallace-Wells did the right thing. If all of the warnings given to us so far have not caused us to change, this huge warning in the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” will. 
              <br><br>


 This article definitely woke me up as well. I would be lying if I said the article did not frighten me, but sometimes fear is the only way to cause someone to change and take action. I agree that the section on “Heat Death” was horrifying and it was interesting to read. The section that I found the most interesting was “Doomsday”. It wasn’t the section as a whole that caught my attention but the last paragraph that did. That paragraph mentions that by conquering and abusing the natural world we have only provoked it to fight back. It is just crazy to me to think that our habitat and our home is our biggest threat, but of course this is all our fault. Earth has given us a home and has taken care of us for quite some time; I say that it is now time that we change and start taking care of the Earth.
<br><hr>
After reading “The uninhabitable earth”, I disagree with the author on the state of the world as he views it in an irreversible decay--like a carcass. I agree with you, the author has a pessimistic outlook on the whole climate crisis situation. Even the name suggests the author’s feelings without hiding it. The author comes to terms how people are too stubborn to accept the climate crisis to act accordingly in a group to work together to work effectively to put an end to it. By the time people realize and open their eyes to the situation, it is too late. 
              <br><br>
I disagree with the author because I believe the world can still be saved if we focus or resources to the climate crisis situation as a group rather than separately. The climate situation affects every single one of us, so taking the challenge alone is a stubborn decision
              <br><hr>
I would disagree with your stance on how Wells was an alarmist. To me my impression while reading the article it seemed as if he really was trying to get us worried and make us feel obligated to act. I agree with Ken how this kind of tone can really have a different effect on people. Some will spring into action to help change the world and fix the climate crisis while others may just feel like their efforts won't make a difference and sit there feeling hopeless like all of the things that they just read cannot be stopped. I do agree that this did give me a wake-up call of sorts. I was aware of some of the things that could happen but not the extent that they would go to.
              <br><hr>

I agree with your opinion in every aspect. David Wallace Wells was probably called an alarmist by certain people because deep down the critics don’t want to embrace the fact that those astonishing facts pointed out by Mr. Wells might, if no further interference is conducted in the future, take place on this fragile planet. But as you mentioned, sugar coating the problem won’t encourage people to take into effect the remedy measures.
<br><br>
Furthermore, just as you can’t demand someone who can hardly feed himself to give up his meat-based diet, it is unrealistic to ask developed countries to give up their effort to get their people out of poverty even though the process may add up to the already heavy burden imposed on the earth. Not to mention that they are the community that suffers the most from the consequences of global warming. What we should do is to share the knowledge and experience that we gain throughout our years of struggle and try to minimize the harm together.
<br><hr>
I think that Wallace being categorized as an 'alarmist' is not so much a result of the definition of an alarmist, but a result of others' (especially those denying climate change) response to his passion and tactics used in his article to try and promote action in others. I do certainly agree with you though that with the severity of climate change, it is personally hard to see Wallace as an alarmist when like you said, there's simply no more time to sugar coat our situation. New Oxford Dictionary can also tend to have antiquated and conservative definitions, so perhaps this definition is one that supports more of a climate deny-ist viewpoint by saying alarmists cause "needless worry." I'm not saying your choice of including this definition is anything against you, in fact I chose to reply on your comment because I thought it was very thought provoking to include it, but I do think that it is valuable to look at the sources in which information comes from to see which ways they can be skewed or potentially biased. 
               <br><br>
For many, I think that Wallace’s bold approach can definitely be incapacitating. As even I experienced, his alarmist approach is so bold that the issues at hand seem impossible to overcome and not even worth trying to stop with how far deep he explains we are. His more optimistic closing though, even if it potentially was a little unreasonable, made the doomsday gloom of the rest of the piece much more tolerable. If he hadn’t included some form of hope at the end, the whole article would have felt like he was presenting us with an impossible problem to overcome. I personally found it motivating and inspiring that we can (hopefully) come together and help ourselves with the crisis we’ve created. 
               <br><br>
The worry that Wallace presented that most concerned me was climate plagues. I consider myself very knowledgeable with the climate crisis and the issues we are to face with it, but this was something new for me. I had never considered or heard of the unknown risk of diseases and bacteria long trapped in the ice, now melting, that would be introduced to our unsuspecting immune systems and the damage they can and will cause. Although his other points greatly concern me as well, because this one was particularly new, it had a much stronger effect on me as I learned yet another consequence of climate change.

              <br><hr>

After reading your comment, I agree with everything you are saying. Thank you for providing the definition. Because by that definition David Wallace Wells is in no way an alarmist. He is pointing out facts that will be our reality if something does not get done about the climate crisis we are in. He is not trying to scare us but is instead trying to scare us about what our earth will be like in the future if we do not heed to the examples set by past generations now. The author has a rather pessimistic outlook on our current situation we have put ourselves in, but it is explainable because of the reality of it all.
               <br><br>

 By the time most people will finally come to terms with the fact that we will not have an earth if we do not do something about it in a timely matter, it won't matter anymore. That's why people like Wallace Wells who are scaring us straight now are the pole who are ultimately going to be saving the planet in the long run. As long as there are people out there who are still trying to convince the world that climate change is a made-up hoax, we need “alarmists” to scare people into the truth. Wallace isn't doing it in a malicious way, he's really just trying to help ourselves and our future generations.

While I agree that David Wallace-Wells is not an alarmist, I think his point of view is focused mainly on the worst case scenario which is why many call his point of view that of an "alarmist". Also, this article is legitimately "alarming" to many of the readers who maybe know little to nothing about anthropogenic climate change. I think this article is a good wake up call, as you said, to the realities of climate change. It makes the grim future of humanity, if it stays the current course, seem more tangible, as terrifying as that may be, which is important to get people to truly grasp the seriousness of the situation and the dire need for change.


              <br><hr>

I completely agree with your opinion that David Wallace Wells should not be called an alarmist because of the statements he makes in his article, "The Uninhabitable Earth". I simply do not understand those who do not believe in climate change and can still ignore and argue with scientific evidence that devastating events will happen to our planet and the human population as a whole if we do not change our ways. Wells is simply stating scientifically proven events that could occur in the near future and all one can do is call him an alarmist? I do not believe that Wells is "exaggerating a danger". Climate change is a scary issue that is happening and yet we go on living our lives free of care until it is something that personally affects us in our own community. I believe that so many reacted to his article so harshly because Wells took a different approach in addressing the dangers of climate change. Most articles simply talk about issues such as sea level rise, but Wells stated some dangerous events that others had never mentioned before. For this reason, I believe that those who called Wells an alarmist was because they were scared of what he had to say and instead of worrying and making themselves anxious, they simply choose to deny and ignore it to move on with their day.

              <br><hr>




Regarding your point of view that Wallace-Wells, I agree that he should not be called an alarmist. Instead of this term, I would like to call him more of an informer, giving us information that we otherwise would be unaware of. Reading this article, I know for me personally that there are many other effects of climate change that I would never have known of. Never would I have thought that diseases from hundreds of years ago that killed huge amounts of the population of the earth could be reintroduced from thawing ice. The more obvious effects like rising temperatures and sea levels are things most are already aware of, but I doubt many of us would ever think we might have to deal with another epidemic in addition to the problems. Wallace-wells also gives us information on the spreading of current diseases in our world. I would think, living in California, there is no need for me to worry about diseases like zika or malaria. However, he explains that as temperatures increase, the areas of rainforest that carry these disease-carrying mosquitos will migrate farther north and more people will be affected. Wallace-Wells definitely gave me a greater view of the effects of climate change, making me take the matter much more seriously. I now realize there are many more problems that can and do affect me, whereas before this just seemed like a problem for other people.
              <br><hr>

I agree with you entirely. Wallace-Wells is not being an alarmist in any sense. What he is talking about is not a false issue nor is it an exaggerated one. The issue he talks about is real and will scientifically happen unless we change our ways and thus the course of the results. While his detailed descriptions of the disasters that are happening and what will eventually happen are terrifying, it is simply the truth. There isn't anything exaggerated about the scientific evidence, and it's scary enough to the point where one could accidentally classify him as an alarmist. Like he said, these scenarios seem like they would be a nightmare of a future for us, but the fact of the matter is that it is our future. Our margin for success at this point is small unless vast and aggressive actions are taken. The article states horrors such as essentially being cooked to death and bugs and bacteria that is being revived from the ice and coming to wipe out vast populations. Yes, the way he said it is in a tone that does make us seem worried, but honestly, I think the issue itself is worrying enough. He could've said it any other way, and it would still be just as terrifying. But you're right in the sense that there is no other way to say it; we can't sugarcoat these issues any longer.

              <br><hr>
I somewhat agree with your stance about David Wallace Wells being an alarmist. I do believe that everything that he stated is factual and proven to occur in the future at the current rate climate change is heading towards, however, his wording and method going about the facts is worded in a specific format to cause alarm. I am in no way saying that what he talks about isn't alarming at all, but the way that he formats his statements is to cause instant panic and heavy anxiety, the type that can scare away more delicate readers.

I do not think the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth," by David Wallace-Wells was too alarmist in nature. His transparency and bluntness impacted me intensely and prompted me to act almost right then and there. His urgency feels extremely necessary considering what devastating events due climate change might lie ahead. If we pumped a record of 40.5 Billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air in 2019, his approach to the article is only honest and brave and works to inspire people everywhere to take this global climate crisis seriously. I am guilty of ignorance in this subject area, and I needed to be instilled with some fear from Wells to be pushed to understand the urgency of the issue myself. 
              <br><br>

Wells laid out for us the many possible negative outcomes of this crisis if we proceed without action. I particularly liked how he described why these outcomes will occur, not only the fact that they will. With every degree of warming, our yields decline by 10 percent. That means less food for our continuously expanding populations. We will soon be exposed to diseases trapped in the ice if the ice melts. Our oceans are becoming warmer and more acidic. The list goes on but I responded well to the way this article was written!

<p>
This article is certainly written with a sense of panic, in which said panic is intended to be passed on to the readers. This article did not reiterate the same schtick that we’ve heard millions of times about climate change. Rather, it spoke on the more disastrous, unfortunate truths that will happen if we let climate change get worse to a point of no return.

One thing that I was not aware of is that arctic permafrost is filled with methane, and methane is a substantially more dangerous substance than carbon when it comes to the greenhouse effect. The fact that the planet’s climate change issue may be occurring faster than we once thought and can potentially free all of that frozen methane into our atmosphere is very alarming and may make the reader want to do something about it before it becomes too late. 
              <br><br>

What I found most effective is the sense of fear that the article gave the reader by giving the audience a peek into what the future would look like if climate change became too severe. From describing potential heat waves that have proven to be deadly but will be the norm, to famine worse than that of the dust bowl, Wallace-Wells does a great job at imposing fear with the ultimate goal of getting people on his side against climate change, and to get those already on his side to act quicker.

Wallace-Wells provides a necessary urgency to the situation at hand that affects every human being whether they are aware of it or not, justifying his stance and attitude toward the issue presented to his readers. For what purpose does censorship or ignorance of such information to the public prove in this time of desperate need of action to the declining state of our climate and ecosystems’ ability to survive. Personally, I was moved by the facts presented through the different categories Wallace-Wells touched upon through the organization of his article. Expanding upon my and probably many others’ knowledge of climate change to cause rising sea levels, I learned that there are many more consequences at stake and that the timeline for such matters is more urgent than I had believed. For example, the bleaching of the coral reefs that affects other ecosystems as well, and diseases trapped within the arctic ice.
              <br><br>

Whether truly an alarmist or not, I believe his approach is extremely necessary, especially with the immense gravity of the situation at hand that poses a threat to both current and future generations. Honestly, the consequences listed may be difficult to visualize and comprehend from personal experiences as I haven’t faced such disasters personally, which may affect my own perspective to this problem. However, this doesn’t mean I should dismiss it at all or live ignorantly in regards to it. 
              <br><br>

The specific consequence of climate change I found most alarming was the climate plagues that would be released from the Arctic, spreading diseases that our immune systems would be unable to handle and without even realizing its presence in the air surrounding us. The danger of such illnesses rapidly spreading among populations would cause tragic outbreaks that we would be unprepared for.
              <br><br>

Something that stood out to me was Fermi’s paradox that proposes “If the universe is so large why haven’t we encountered any other intelligent life,” leading to the possibility that other civilizations were unable to withstand the conditions of their own changing climate and inability to survive before ceasing to exist. For if our civilization is headed down the same path, the inevitability of our failure will become clear as ever. I just hope that the climate scientists’ “strange faith” in the ingenuity and capabilities of mankind truly find a solution and reverse the devastating consequences before it is too late.

After reading the article by Wallace Wells, I acquired more awareness on the topic of the climate crisis. I never realized the immense amount of impacts changing climate had on us, and I think Wells did a great job clarifying each one. Learning more about the impact of climate Plagues was definitely clarifying for me because I wasn’t ever aware of the specifics before. I found it crazy that diseases we haven’t encountered yet were found in the Arctic ice. I also found it surprising that remnants of the deadly 1918 flu that killed over 100 million people were found, along with traces of smallpox and bubonic plagues in Siberian ice. I always knew the climate crisis was serious, but never knew we could encounter life changing impacts such as these diseases. I also found the section on perpetual war very compelling. This is another topic I did not know much about before reading this article. The research by Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang was interesting when they stated the relationship between temperature and violence. Their research showed that for every half-degree of warming, societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict. I found this topic the most interesting in the entire article because I never knew there was a correlation between violence and temperature. It is crazy to think researchers were able to find information to correlate these two different ideas. 

              <br><br>

Overall, I was surprised to see the amount of people who believed there was no negative affect on Earth due to climate changes as well. I believe it is crucial for everyone to be educated on this topic so everyone is aware of the future dangers we are going to be facing. I wasn’t well informed on many of these issues/impacts, but after reading this article I am truly scared of what will happen in the future and what the fate of our Earth will be. This article opened my eyes on ways we can help prevent temperatures rising quickly and I definitely am more compelled to make a change in my own life after learning about the issues we are soon going to face.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, by David Wallace-Wells I don’t think Wallace-Wells could be categorized as an alarmist. In the annotated version he started off with a preface that explained why he wrote what he did. Thinking about the definition of an alarmist, I also wouldn't consider what he wrote an exaggerated danger nor a needless one because it’s very much happening and if people have to be scared to take action then it’s needed. 
              <br><br>
Honestly before reading more into climate change I was like whatever about it. I knew it was happening but I didn't think of it as an alarming danger. After reading I felt like crying, I was actually a bit scared about all that was said but it’s what made me realize that I want to do something about what’s happening. There were a couple things that made me relate and think back like omg that’s true I remember something like this happening.
              <br><br>
The sections that were most compelling to me were most of them but climate plague and the unbreathable air were the one that frightened me the most. I pictured myself getting sick from one of the diseases and it honestly scared me because I don’t have the best immune system, I get really sick and it takes more than 2 weeks to get better. I don’t want my loved ones or myself getting a deadly virus. And the thought of not being able to breath also scared me, slow death sounds so scary.
              <br><br>
David Wallace-Wells article really paint a horrifying picture about what is likely to happen if we don’t change. It really explains and makes you think about the reality that will soon be of the earth. Most people, myself included, don't know how bad climate change is affecting us and how we are the main contributors to the rates getting shorter. This changed my views completely about the climate and if more people were to see it could make them so something about the crisis.

Before reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I thought he would simply reveal to people that we are creating our own extinction. I thought he’d talk about how the globe is constantly getting warmer and warmer, maybe only give the example of the sea levels rising and how we’re killing the polar bears or something. If he brought up any root causes to these warmings it would be forms of transportation such as cars, planes, and trains, or perhaps factories and e-waste. Looking back now, I feel so ignorant for thinking climate change was so transparent, for thinking I had it mostly figured out. Turns out I haven’t even scratched the surface with the knowledge about climate change and all of it’s possible impacts on our world, as well as the living being on it.
  <br><br>
    Before reading this article, I didn’t know what permafrost even was, let alone that it’s being melted around a global food bank called Doomsday that’s supposed to ensure the survival of our agriculture. It seems that we find a way to destroy the things that are even supposed to be permanent. I feel completely brainwashed, as if my younger education was fake when I learned that the extinction of the dinosaurs was actually caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gases, not an asteroid. There’s a large amount of people that go to Europe for vacation in the summer, so to think that summers in Europe will soon become inhabitable because of the heat is surreal. My brain also thinks about Europe’s economy then, how much of their income is probably from tourism in the summer and how not having tourism will damage their economy. To think, as early as 2080, without drastic reductions in emissions, places such as southern Europe can be in an extreme drought, permanently. It truly brings to light how little room for error we have in the following decades before our future is set in stone. I wasn’t aware that diseases could even get trapped by the ice, so to think that this ice could be melted and unleash these diseases is scary and makes me curious how the human body would react to the diseases that existed before the human race did. It’s shocking reading this article in 2020 considering it was written in 2017 because at least one of the worries already happened. The Amazon forest did in fact catch on fire in 2019, which I knew, however I didn’t know til now that this forest provided as much as 20% of our oxygen. It makes me wonder if any of the predictions written in this article might come even sooner than expected.

Your sentences about Europe are really interesting. The impacts of climate change are so varied and numerous and go beyond the more "cliche" scenarios. We hear about the spectacular and morbid realities of death and destruction but there are also more complex social and economical impacts. I've definitely experienced summers in Europe that were much hotter than they should have been. These heat waves can damage tourism, as you said, but also dramatically change the life of a country. If Spain becomes a desert, no more Spanish wine. And that's a shame.
<br><br>

Obviously, the more dramatic impacts are more important and urgent, but there are so many cases to take into account.

In his article "The Uninhabitable Earth," David Wallace-Wells addresses the wide array of consequences of the climate crisis. Whether or not he should be considered an "alarmist" does not personally strike me as a very important distinction to make: the impact of the article is personal to each reader and independent of his intention. Personally, although the facts presented instilled a sense of fear in me, I did not feel that he was hoping to scare every reader of his article; rather, I felt that he did an excellent job of presenting the multi-pronged effects of climate change in a factual manner. The statistics enough, though real skeptics may doubt their accuracy and point to that as proof of Wells' intention to frighten people, are frightening enough on their own to anyone who takes them as fact. Regardless, I appreciate Wells' dialogue on consequences like plague revival and evolution or increases in conflict, which are often overlooked in the discussion of the climate crisis. Although I was already aware of more science-based consequences like sea level rises, ocean acidification, and smog, I had never thought about all of the political and economic aspects of the issue. I have a tendency to approach the issue of climate change from a political standpoint, as I believe that the state of international politics around the issue is the largest barrier to making the changes worldwide that are needed to solve the issue. The connections Wells makes of climate change to increased military conflict really struck me as something that not many people think about, and could potentially be more convinced by if they are not moved by talk of hurricanes and melting ice caps. Especially for Americans, as we have seen in responses to current events involving Iran, the prospect of war can quickly facilitate action and increased dialogue: the type of "alarmist" response that some would expect from an article like this. Perhaps if there was more attention on this aspect of the climate crisis, domestic and international action would occur faster. On another note, I was also struck by Wells' lack of addressing the disproportional effects of climate change for less developed countries and poorer communities. Although he did touch on these effects happening in various parts of the world, I believe he was strongly writing to an American audience: stressing the "heat stress in New York City," tying climate change to increases in children born with autism like the "epidemic in West Hollywood," and failing to note that of the mass deaths caused by climate change, many will likely be non-Americans. People who cannot immigrate out of the areas that become too hot to inhabit, African coastal countries that rely on fish for their protein and survival, communities with less infrastructure, money and resources to afford the climate events around them. I was not sure to be disappointed by this somewhat privileged viewpoint or appreciative of the fact that if his intended audience is the average American, they would likely not be affected by these distinctions anyways.

I have always considered myself an environmentalist, I do my best to leave a small carbon footprint, and for a long time have known of many of the repercussions of climate change. However, there are few points when I have looked at all the factors, effects, and projections together. I fear a future filled with climate refugees from drowned coastal cities like Miami and Bangladesh, or a world in which I must tell young people about all the extinct species and how great they were when they were still around. 
   <br><br>
With that said, I was interested in effects of climate change that I have never heard discussed or expressed. The effect a 11-12 degree change would have on the equatorial region will physically have on humans, basically cooking them, I have not previously thought of. This aspect of climate change is more terrifying than the slowly rising ocean waters or increased water temperatures as it would directly effect everything on land in the area. In addition, the idea of heat exhaustion cause kidney failure through dehydration also had not crossed my mind. Growing up in the warmest part of the central valley, regularly experiencing summer temperatures in the hundred and teens, I have been a little blind to the effect those temperatures would have on areas who lack powerful air conditioning. I had not considered the prospect of ancient diseases being released from permafrost, nor the fact that some diseases thrive in warmer temperatures. Overall the article increases my desire to help bring about change to limit climate change and is well written, I would recommend it to a friend or possibly use it as a source for future essays.

David Wallace Wells is an alarmist, and rightfully so. We are beyond the point where we can sugarcoat the facts and possible consequences. Wallace-Wells might have taken an semi-apocalyptic approach however, he backs his approach with scientific evidence. He did not sit and write a fictitious parable, he wrote possible futures that could eventually come to fruition if we don’t take immediate action. Humans have a fight or flight response to a crisis like this, and it becomes dangerous territory when articles like this come out. Climate Change is a complex and seemingly impossible issue to tackle for ordinary civilians like the general population, so it can become natural to have a flight response, and succumb to inaction. When I first read this article, I was previously aware of how disastrously complex climate change is, however, Wallace-Wells makes it his goal to really outline just what could happen if we don't take action soon. What really surprised me was reading about the climate plagues - we truly, as of now - are not ready to deal with all the impacts of climate change all at once. I felt prompted to action, I have felt prompted to action for a long time now. I don’t want to look back in 50-60 years and say I should have done something, because by them - it will be too late. I don't want to be complacent about this crisis, and that is why I'm taking this class, and continuously informing myself on how I can be more sustainable. I do believe the alarmist tact alienates certain people - such as highly sensitive people or people who are not as aware of how the climate works. Be in all honesty this isn't meant to detail all the nooks and crannies or be sensitive to certain groups - its suppose to paint a picture with scientific facts we already have. It's a what is going to happen if we don't do something now.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells illustrates a scary future that we will have to face on this planet if nothing is done regarding the looming dangers we face in terms of food, population, and climate, among other things. Wallace-Wells offers insight as to how we must combat these impending environmental threats, mainly by using the likely end results of the problems to prompt or even scare the reader into action. 
   <br><br>


I would hesitate to call Wells an alarmist as that is a person who causes needless panic; however, at this rate there is a need for panic as our Earth is nearing irreversible living conditions as a result of food waste and overpopulation. Wells may be an alarmist in the sense that he strays from the conventional method of report, but it is necessary as he must threaten people's sense of future well-being in order to invoke action. 

   <br><br>

On the other hand, the extremes that the author continuously points out in the article may have the opposite effects on a skeptical reader,  who then might be less inclined to take action as he or she may see it as a far-fetched, "worst-case scenario" argument. Thus, the skeptic might believe it is another over the top push for climate activism where in fact it is the reality of the situation if action is not taken.

After reading David Wallace Wells' article titled "The Uninhabitable Earth", I was able to take away the same general ideas that you did regarding his views on what is in store for the planet if nothing is done to resolve the growing climate crisis that Earth faces. In addition to that, I would also agree that Wells is not an alarmist since his arguments about what is in store for the economy, environment, food supply, etc,  are all justified by the evidence he provides in each section of his article. I do understand where people may have drawn the conclusion that he is an alarmist because he seems to be presenting the worst possible outcomes for Earth. I believe that Wells could decrease the amounts of skepticism surrounding his name by focusing on the major points of each section of his article, instead of presenting readers with a massive amount of information that makes it seem like he is relying on sheer quantity as opposed to quality of information. Ultimately, I believe that Wells' article was effective in communicating a sense of urgency in correcting the climate crisis, by whatever means it took.

<p>
In David Wallace-Well’s “The Uninhabitable Earth,” he discusses the schedule that the Earth’s climate is on as well as the trajectory and process in which certain events may take place. I believe that the reasoning and justification of the points that Wallace-Wells made were not unfounded; he is not placing irrelevant, inconclusive, and misinformed situations for no apparent reason. That is to say, he is not making this up. Rather, from the research that can be looked into, the predictions that he deduces are ones that are somewhat valid. However, I preface this to say that Wallace-Wells does not create an “alarming” tone for no particular reason. Yes, some readers may find the nature of the article that of a “climate alarmist.” Yet, what readers might fail to see is that besides being supported, Wallace is deploying journalist strategies that allow himself, as well as his article, to gain more traction and place more emphasis on the necessity for audiences’ action. 
   <br><br>


I do not personally believe that all of the scenarios David Wallace-Well brings up will come to fruition. For instance, Wallace continuously brings up the point of the climate continuing to rise in heat, and with current trends, especially of rising climate over the last 5 years of the past decade, as well as current natural disasters such as wildfires in California and Category 5 hurricanes across the Atlantic, I believe that most people would concur with this belief. However, what I do find a bit exaggerated is the idea of unbreathable air. According to Wallace, “high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100.” He states that because of the increase in ppm, the human cognitive ability will decline by 21 percent in comparison to the air that we are currently breathing. Wallace also brings up the fact that many of the wildfires caused deaths, saying that, “339,000 people die from wildfire smoke” each year. He also said that 10,000 people die from small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning. Now, these statistics may seem urgent and dangerous, but I believe that the topic of polluted air will continue to be brought up into debate, which will surely help to push the schedule back. In the next 80 years, I do not find it viable that world leaders and states will not address this issue on a local, state, or even global scale. I believe that longer-term scenarios that are being brought up continue to fade in the limelight because of the distance that our species has from then until now. However, while this may not be the most probable or accurate cause to our planet’s demise, I believe that this article (specifically this section) helps to point out a worst-case scenario situation that urges policymakers to help create legislation that combats wildfires and air pollution within their respective jurisdictions. 

   <br><br>

What I do find interesting, however, is the idea of perpetual war due to climate change. Wallace-Well cites researchers Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang who have, through unknown methods, have managed to quantify correlations between temperature and war. The article reads that societies will, “see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict” for every half-degree of warming. Now, although I do not believe that during the summer, more nations will just be increasingly inclined to go to war. However, I do believe that climate change will bring into discussion a war over non-renewable resources. Climate change continues to eliminate these resources, making them much more scarce than they once were. Countries that find necessity in these resources may see combat and violence as a viable option to obtain these resources. If/when this time does arrive, I believe that we may see a new form of imperialism in the 21st century.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I realized I was most incredibly struck by Wallace-Wells’s claims on climate change’s impacts on human health in the parts titled “Climate Plagues” and “Unbreathable Air.” From taking environmental science classes, I was already aware of the possibility of the spread of diseases due to increased warming in other areas of the world. However, he presents the idea of the presence of prehistoric diseases in ice, a speculation that has never crossed my mind before, although such a factor could evidently have a devastating impact on human health. He also points out that we have already seen an increase in health issues due to inhalation of particulate matter and exposure to smog. Environmental and human health relations, specifically in the studies of environmental justice, have always been a very interesting topic for me, even a possible career path I have considered taking, so I was quite intrigued by Wallace-Wells’s take on it. 

   <br><br>

In the beginning of his article, Wallace-Wells explains that the sections that follow are meant to design an Earth without “aggressive action” in the reader’s mind, hence the different sections emphasizing specific concerns both inside and outside the scientific disciplines. The tone of this article is very apocalyptic and dark, meant to outline the impending doom we are to face without such action. Therefore, I think that one of his overall messages was that global warming is a more alarming phenomenon than is perceived, which he attributed to the lack of radical adjustment, despite the science put forth already and the facts being uncovered today. Even as a major in environmental studies, I am not always fully aware of the threat that climate change poses to me personally. I think that one of the major steps to even beginning to solve such issues has to do with the constant acknowledgement that we are all deeply connected to the Earth.

Hey! I too was struck by the "unbreathable air" aspect of the climate crisis. In regard to the melting ice and with that, the release of possible sicknesses- do you think this aspect of the climate crisis is too late to confront? As ken mentioned, by 2050 the north pole is expected to be able to sail through, which makes me think about the melting ice and how inevitable it feels. I am wondering if this sense of inevitable doom inspires you to act or makes you feel as though there is no point in trying to confront the already dooming climate crisis?
<br><hr>

I also constantly wonder whether or not it is too late to address these large scale issues such as the melting of polar ice caps as well as feel the weight of the inevitability of such climate crisis events. I even see the scientific evidence of the climate crisis as quite frightening at times. However, I do think the facts I have learned thus far have instilled a sense of urgency and motivation more than a feeling of utter doom. For this reason, I was intrigued to pursue a major in Environmental Studies and hope to make a larger impact with a future career in this field. For now, I think any steps that are taken to further educate oneself and others on how they can take part in the fight against the climate crisis through activities such as lobbying or even simply changing one's diet are major steps to change.

When I read David Wallace's " The Uninhabitable Earth" I was shocked at the countless disastrous byproducts of global warming.  He paints a picture of a doomed world that is plagued by greenhouse gases. Wallace is an alarmist in every sense of the word with the dystopic future he paints if humanity does not act.  However, I don’t think that his words should be discredited because of this.  He is using a harsh view of the climate crisis to wake those that don’t believe that the Earth’s temperature rising by 2-4 degrees Celsius is a problem.  His words were frightening but not without purpose.  Each chapter introduces another looming threat to the human race.  Wallace is brutally honest and holds no punches explaining the dire condition the earth is in, to the reader.  “The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock” gave me a real idea of what the stakes are.  When I finished reading the article I felt hopeless at first, but then I remembered a very important fact.  The list of actions we can take to do our part to decrease carbon emissions.  After this realization that I can make a difference, my attitude changed completely.  
   <br><br>

Out of Wallace’s repercussions for continuing to allow carbon emissions to cloud the Earth’s atmosphere,  the most terrifying to me is The section “ Unbreathable Air”.  This problem feels more real in a sense than the others with abundant air pollution is already a mess in Beijing so it makes perfect sense that in 50 years the world will experience the same increase.  A line that literally gave me goosebumps “ By 2090, as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the "WHO safe level''.  This statistic is insane to me.  ¼ of the entire world will be breathing air that isn’t considered safe.  All the carbon emissions are contaminating the air that sustains human life.  This made the section about Air pollution the most compelling and the most terrifying.



</p><hr>

<p>
"By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China". "Already, more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning; each year, 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season". "By 2050, 5.2 billion people have been reckoned to contract Malaria". These are three quotes that I pulled from David Wallace-Wells' article "The Inhabitable Earth" and although these facts can be used against him for having an alarmist approach, the information is important and has to be shared. Reading through this article absolutely shocked me. I thought I understood the basics of climate change but I really don't. In this class, Ken spoke shortly about how if we can do anything extreme in order to turn this damage around we have to start by reducing the population and the amount of food that is being produced. I have kept that thought with me ever since he said it and what I am seeing from this article is that the earth is going to take on that task. The mass population reduction from the "re-birth" of old diseases, the wiping out of florida and Bangladesh within this century, the rising temperatures that will make many places entirely inhabitable, create mass amount of drought and diminish the food supply. What is happening on our planet now is the process of another mass extinction. After reading this article it made me feel extremely bummed out. There does not seem like theres a lot of hope for our planet unless extreme and quick changes are made. Although this article does have a very alarmist approach I don't think that it is a negative thing. People globally need to understand the severity of this situation and how many systems this catastrophe is going to take down. I think because the reality of this article is semi "dooms day-ish" it can turn people away from it because "what they don't know wont hurt them". I feel like when it comes to bad news people are quick to turn a blind eye because they don't want to listen to the reality of the situation, or because they don't think its going to effect them. Articles like this, although daunting, are important and need to be shared with more people. It is hard for me to understand how there are still people who can read this and be in complete denial that climate change is even real. It is that mindset that fuels the path we are on, which will lead to irreversible damage. Although it is nice to think that Elon Musk will be able to create the Mars habitats in the next "40-100 years", there is no saying that its even possible, and even if that does happen we will be bringing the same toxic tendencies of destroying our ecosystem with us.

It seems that no matter how many warnings some people get, they still aren’t understanding the true impacts of climate change. David Wallace-Wells highlights the extreme urgency in this issue in his article “The Uninhabitable Earth”. It would be unfair to say that he is exaggerating the dangers that are upon us, as they are all valid and backed up by real evidence. Although I've learned a lot about climate change in school, I never felt directly connected to the issue. The way its been taught to me so far has made it feel like a distant concept that has no impact on me directly. This article opened my eyes and showed me how the effects of global warming are much closer to me than I thought. It also helped me realize that climate change affects humans the most. Many people don’t care about the issue because they think it doesn’t directly affect them, but in reality, if the human race gets wiped out, the Earth will still be here. It might be a bit damaged, but it will recover once we're gone, and new species will evolve. If people thought about climate change in this light, more people would care about it. Wallace brings up an interesting point about our economy that I have never even considered before. He states that for every degree celsius of warming, it will cost us 1.2% of GDP. Much of the reason climate change is even occurring in the first place is because of the greedy nature of people in power. If those people would listen and understand that in the long run, climate change will cause our economy to collapse, they might reconsider their actions. For everyday people, it is often difficult for them to believe their actions are making a difference in the grand scheme of things. It's the same thing with voting. A large percentage of our country doesn’t vote because they believe their singular vote will not make a difference in the election. But if everyone has that mindset, then nobody will end up voting, and their preferred candidate might lose. Similarly, if everyone thinks their actions will not contribute to climate change, we will never be able to solve this issue. Climate change should be treated at an emergency, not an issue.

I found “The Uninhabitable Earth” a really impactful read. Wallace-Wells describes the climate crisis in a manner that most people could understand, which helps the severity of the issue become more known to a wider range of people. By intermingling scientific data, impacts on the environment, and how they will impact our everyday lives, I feel he connected the climate crisis to many parts of my life that I didn't even consider- as well as bringing light to other areas of the world that are already facing the consequences of the climate crisis (the acidification of the Gulf of Mexico, for example) that I was not aware of. I feel this approach entices and motivates the reader to want to take action to prevent the results that could occur if we as a global community continue to act irresponsibly regarding our planet, as well as motivate them to become more aware of the impacts of climate change not just in their cities/countries, but globally. 
    <br><br>
Personally, I don’t find Wallace-Wells to be an alarmist- I think he’s rightfully passionate about the subject. I think in alarmist is somebody who is unjust in their worry/concern over an issue, and I do not think Wallace-Wells is being dramatic about this issue at all. I think skirting around the issue would be more dangerous than an article of this nature. In fact, I appreciate that he addressed how he feels scientists need to be more aggressive/forward with the severity of the issues of the climate crisis in order to get people to actually listen. I feel that the severity and matter-of-fact attitude he discusses the subject matter with is completely justified- this is a pressing matter with severe consequences that needed to be stated and dealt with immediately. I feel like if people find these facts “scary” then it will/should motivate them into action.

I agree with you very much. In this article, I learned some unexpected knowledge. For example, the temperature in the tropics is too high to grow grains effectively, and many arable lands have become deserts. The impact of climate change on the economy is also unexpected. The author lists specific statistical data to show that climate change The possibility of per capita GDP decline has been greatly increased. In order to achieve the goal of Paris, the emission of land use must be cleared. And we will need to invent technology to extract twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet's factories do now. After reading this article, I realized the seriousness of climate change and wanted to take action. To protect our planet. I have an optimistic attitude towards solving global climate change. Because human beings can create the world. Climate change will also create new technologies to solve this problem.

Although Wallace-Wells paints a grim image of our future planet in his article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” his points carry validity backed by research from climatologists rather than exaggerated rhetoric drawn to scare readers. Incapacitating his audience with fear is the opposite of his goal; instead, Wells aims to bring attention to the severity of the climate crisis so that people are more inclined to take action. As stated in his work, many reports sugarcoat their conclusions, and it is difficult for many people to imagine the long term impacts of actions made today. These factors reduce people’s willingness to take immediate action on an issue pertinent to all life. As a result, his seemingly alarmist approach may be effective in urging individuals to make changes that would contribute to a better outcome for the planet.
    <br><br>


After reading the article, I found the argument about “perpetual war” to be most compelling. I often hear about the consequences of climate change on the direct environment, but this argument investigates the further detrimental impacts on the functioning of societies. Societies are built off of their environments, both as a place to live and for resources. Especially with the rise of globalization, climate change in one region has a domino effect on the rest of the world. Scarcity of resources and habitable land has been a constant factor in human conflict, which would only be furthered by climate change.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, Wallace-Wells lists different ways how climate change could soon make the Earth uninhabitable.  He is very upfront about issues that we will soon face.  Reading the article made me feel pessimistic about our future.  It’s unbelievable that ⅕ of the population of El Salvador has chronic liver disease due to dehydration, and that the Amazon could dry out in 5 years.  He also brought up issues I had never thought about, such as how melting glaciers can release ancient diseases.  I think the article was written in a way that is purposefully alarming.  Many people will only take action once they realize that our current lifestyle is unsustainable.

David Wallace-Wells' "The Uninhabitable Earth" is a very pessimistic article that illustrates the consequence of climate change if human's don't drastically change their lifestyle. His style is very alarming, which has both positive and negative effects. The positive effects are that is hopefully scares his audience into action; we have no time to lose. Hopefully the audience will take it as inspirational and realize we have no time to continue questioning the severity of this issue.The negative effects of his alarmist style is that he risks killing the little amount of hope left. Personally, when I was reading his article, I questioned why I was even reading it. What was the point of doing my homework and trying my best in school if the world is crumbling around me? Why fight for the planet if my efforts won't make a dent in the human caused catastrophe that is known as the climate emergency? Are my visions of the future where I'm living happily in a stable environment with my family just a pipe dream? Wells' writing might have a tendency to do the opposite of what it intends too, but I respect the alarmist style. We cannot sugar coat what is happening to the environment. Wallace-Wells' article is a much needed slap in the face for everyone, and I hope his audience take action after reading is.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” David Wallace-Wells argues that the threats posed by climate change are more potent and far-reaching than commonly believed. He delivers this argument by explaining how the most commonly known effects and risks of climate change do not come close to the totality of damage to human life and our earth system that could and likely will occur if action is not taken. Wallace-Well’s tone in the piece in unmistakably pessimistic, which distinguishes this piece from other popular takes on climate change that stress that worst-case scenarios can be avoided with policy and cultural changes. He highlights the fact that even with immediate and far-reaching changes we have already guaranteed a future with catastrophic consequences. For instance, he treats the destruction of coastal cities such as Miami as an inevitability, and quotes researchers that share his opinion that even with the almost complete elimination of fossil fuels, which is extremely unlikely in the near future, sea levels will continue to rise enough that such devastating eventualities will quickly become reality. While Wallace-Well’s piece can be interpreted as alarmist, that label assumes irrationality on his part and ignores the fact that the entire purpose of his piece was to shock people into confronting the problem of climate change by presenting horrific predictions for the future of life. 
       <br><br>
  This article is very effective in compelling people who have previously dismissed the seriousness of the climate crisis by failing to understand the immediate possibility for changes in the earth system that will change the lives of every person. It is easy to ignore the crisis if your life is not yet effected in a meaningful way, many people watch flooding on the weather channel or read about wildfires in the safety of their own home and view the crisis as something that affects other people and not themselves. However, Wallace-Wells makes the point that when the crisis reaches a point of impacting everyone, the situation will have reached a point of a catastrophe unlike any other the human race has experienced. His tone and approach is needed and effective at forcing people to content with this situation and take decisive action before it is too late.

I agree with your sentiment that Wallace-Wells prescribes to a pessimistic but, in turn, much needed alarmist tone in his article. As I generally consider myself to be fairly well-informed on climate-change related issues, I was principally shocked and am deeply concerned about some of the scenarios the article outlines. For instance, the return of historically dormant or otherwise extinct diseases is especially frightening because of the speed at which an outbreak could spread and decimate populations as we know them. In this sense, I agree that Wallace-Wells wrote with the intention of shocking readers and thereby accomplished his goal. At the same time, I believe that this article does serve in part as another example of information overload in a way that causes fear-based paralysis. Essentially, even when an article like this is factually based, the shock-value to an average reader may well leave them with a feeling of hopelessness when the intended effect ought to be a call to action. 
       <br><br>


In this sense, while I believe the article effectively strikes the seriousness of the issue, it fails to provide adequate direction for readers. For example, when detailing the devastating potential damage which could be caused by food insecurity (primarily the possible need to literally move agricultural production to fairer-weather areas in the future, complicated by limited fertility in the soil), I believe there was an opportunity to provide an attainable individual goal. In contrast to the volume of gut-wrenching macro-data that Wallace-Wells provides, I believe that was an excellent place to introduce the potential effect an individual or small group could have by changing their eating habits (ex: reducing beef consumption). While there are plenty of articles which focus on that end of the issue in more depth, I believe a piece like “The Uninhabitable Earth” is actually a more important one in which to include mechanisms of change. While the potential damage is fresh in one’s mind, I believe they are more likely to initiate change.

Here, we explore the implications and consequences of climate change and the mass extinction level threats we face if we do not change on a wide spread level. David Wallace Wells points out 9 different consequences of climate change, that all on their own could halt life as we know it, but combined could mean the end for the human species. Among the most significant arguments for me were his economic and perpetual war arguments.

In today's discourse within the climate change debate, we often hear about the environmental consequences. Many people are willing to make these sacrifices in the name of economic growth however. Most notably the US president. I thought the figure of 1 degree equaling 1.2% of the world GDP to be astounding, and a great rebuttal to those who argue for economic progress. The implications of even just one or two degree climb would mean complete chaos for the world economy
         <br><br>
Additionally the idea of increased war among throughout the world as resources decrease and climates become inhabitable was another indirect consequence that I had not thought about. Even resources such as water could see themselves becoming scarce as time goes on and wars will inevitably be fought over water security, especially in warmer climates.

I have previously read this article for Environmental Studies 1. We had to read this article along with a couple others and respond to the question “Describe three key pieces of evidence that the earth’s climate is changing, and that these changes are being driven by human actions. For each piece of evidence, describe a counter-argument, then present the evidence refuting it.” This article showed a very straight-forward and unsugarcoated view of climate change, and most importantly that its anthropogenic. 
        <br><br>
I think an interesting topic that was discussed in the article was the fact that there aren’t very many fictional books about climate change. There are fictional books about wars and other very deadly times in history but for some reason this isn’t one people want to write about, let alone read. For most people, climate change makes them feel uneasy and most likely incompetent when thinking about how/if they can fix it. Many have chosen to outright ignore the problem, they just want to keep living their lives because, 1) they don’t know enough about the issue and 2) they’ve been told it’s not fixable. With those ideas in mind, can there really be a happy ending to a book about climate change? I think that’s what people look for when reading, a happy ending. If you have very little understanding of climate change, I doubt you would want to read about it knowing the most likely outcome is everyone dying.

From what was stated in David Wallace-Wells’  article “The Inhabitable Earth”, it is made clear multiple times that humans are not taking climate change seriously, and even for those that do, don’t truly understand the severity of it. It is mentioned in the “Doomsday” sectioned that, “no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough.” The section overall is not surprisingly pessimistic, hence the title “Doomsday”. In the second section, “Heat Death”, it states that it’s normal for the weather to cool and heat up but mention that the “…window that allowed for human life is very narrow…” which should be of huge concern. As the years go by, the temperature is getting higher and higher, which is the reason many people are dying, and if not that, then there are the ones that are contracting chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, which has become common to the people of El Salvador. Climate change is not only affecting the human population directly, but also indirectly due to abnormal and catastrophic weather conditions which detrimentally affect our food supply. What I noticed in the third section “The End of Food” is that it did not mention how this would affect the animals, which I thought was important and should be address, because I don’t think these severe droughts are just affecting humans. One thing that concerned me from the fourth section is that there is a possibility for the revival of ancient diseases and infectious organisms in the future if our climate continues change as drastically as it already is. Even now, it is said that the higher temperatures rise, the faster mosquitoes, which for some contain the Zika virus, reproduce. This can lead to the inevitable deaths of many. One of the topics mentioned in this article, which was discussed in lecture was the rise in CO2 levels. It’s getting so out of hand that it is said that the air will be near to unbreathable. In conclusion, all this article talks about is how the Earth is totally doomed. With that in mind it seems most logical that human civilization should prepare to colonize other planets as soon as possible.

As I've grown up and started to learn more about the climate crisis, I am in utter confusion when my elder family members disagree with the alarmist nature of what is happening to our planet right now. Just the other day my grandma told me that the climate crisis isn't really a crisis, we are warming up a little and that's perfectly fine, we'll cool down soon. For a lady who spends most of her time reading news articles and watching the news, most of which can be bias towards one side of the discussion, I am slightly shocked by how much the baby boomer generation is in denial. I have read a few different climate crisis articles but none like "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Well"  who discusses all the factors that will bring our earth to destruction.

        <br><br>

Most shocking to me was Wells' introduction of the many diseases that are trapped within the arctic ice that is at high risk of being melted and released into the atmosphere. As we can all easily recall, the inhabitants on earth experience a mass extinction due to the bubonic plague and many other diseases that used to roam the planet. Water has the ability to carry diseases and by freezing the water, it's likely that the diseases are just waiting to be released. This article is essential for people to read, especially those who believe that the only problem with the climate crisis is the warming of our planet, when in fact there are way more dangers that can cause a mass extinction of earth.

Before reading "The Unhabitable Earth" I thought I was pretty aware of the consequences of climate change however now after reading this article I am now cognizant of how truly disastrous climate change is. First off, the alarmist approach was very clear throughout the article however this approach should not veer people away from the problem. Although this approach may cause uneasiness to some it should make the problems prominent to the reader in order to prompt action. This alarmist nature is ultimately trying to scare the reader while providing facts which may be "extreme" but I think taking these measures are important to take since there are still many speculators in today's society. 
           <br><br>
   Moreover, as I stated before, I had learned that climate change is a lot worse than I thought after reading "The Unhabitable Earth". The first consequence that shocked me was that there are plagues frozen within the ice and when they melt the plague will be released into our atmosphere. This was something I had no idea was even possible and I think this is something valid to consider and is not addressed on mainstream sources. Additionally, the fact that perpetual wars are linked to climate change is something I have never thought of. I found this very interesting and honestly scary. I hope that more people can come to terms with the fact that climate change is something we must act upon NOW instead of putting it aside due to selfish people.

I agree with your statement of  “This alarmist nature is ultimately trying to scare the reader while providing facts which may be ‘extreme’ but I think taking these measures are important…” and believe that people need a wake up call to the severity of our situation. As David Wallace-Wells states, “…the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn’t even see warming as a problem worth addressing” which is a scary thought because in that case, our country is heading down a path of destruction. The people of our country believe that tiny little acts that do not impede their daily lives are enough to fix a problem and I believe that the main reason that this is happening is due to lack of knowledge. Not many people know of the severity of our situation and how if we do not change drastically, we can have irreversible and large problems such as countries disappearing due to ocean levels rising or death by heatwaves around 167 degrees Fahrenheit. If we are able to educate the masses of this situation, we will have a better chance of changing our ways of living so that we can slow things down.
           <br><br>
In this reading, the most shocking part for me was when Wallace-Wells said, “Hydrogen sulfide is also the thing that finally did us that time 97 percent of all life on Earth died…” because we ultimately are repeating history but this time at a faster pace. I believe that some of his “extreme” statements will overall help to educate people so that they begin to help change our systems, but I also believe that some people may become scared of these facts and go into shock. I would not be surprised because even I did not know just how bad our living conditions on Earth could be within my lifetime. Overall, I just hope that we can all work together to make our lives and the next generation's lives not as bad as it is expected to become.

The article by David Wallace-Wells brings the severity of global warming into another level to everyone. It is common for people to believe they have a fair amount understanding about global warming issue. Usually people would connect it with sea-level rising and hotter winter. It is common for people to know that we are facing an issue, but most of us do not know how serious this issue is approaching to. It is crucial for us to know it in order for us to solve it. After reading the article, I am most shocked by the following consequences of global warming. It is not just about sea-level and hot winter, it is about everything in the life. Food shortage, plagues issues from Alaska, the war issues and others are all the consequences from global warming. I have never expect a high temperature can cause wars and bring back plagues. The article give me a clear understanding about this issue.
           <br><br>


Additionally, this article talks about what phase are we on this issue. Although this is not the answer we want, it is the truth that we are on the most crucial moment. Back to not long ago, we set up the goal about 1C-1.5C a year and we think 2C-4C a year is impossible, however the cold fact is that we are exceeding the goal we set up and likely to step into the 2C-4C era. All these cold number is telling us we have no time to wait and we need to do somethings. 

           <br><br>

Although, the article and the author himself have been considered as pessimism, it is still important as a powerful indicator to show us today's situation. This is an old speaking that we as human do not care until it is relate with us. Maybe now we think it is not related with our daily life, but when it starts to relate with everyone, it would be too late to start worry about it. This article might be exaggerated, but it is still important for us to be more prepared.

           <br><br>

After reading this article, I decided to start a little bit in my daily life to help this issue. Turn off the lights, drive less and use bike, save water and buy less plastic products. t might be very small, but if everyone starts to work it, it will add up to big numbers.

Written by David Wallace Wells in 2017, "The Uninhabitable Earth" article was received in many different and controversial ways. For starters, the title of the article itself exudes a sense of urgency as it refers to the planet we currently live as uninhabitable (obviously). Due to this, many readers are taken aback by this "doomsday scenario" Wells articulates in the opening paragraph. Readers can feel how emotionally driven Wells' article is just by the facts he provides. 
           <br><br>

To be honest, I too was certainly alarmed by the sheer numbers Wells provides in his article. He states how the "Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon" and goes on to explain that when the permafrost "thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide". It is understandable if some aren't as alarmed as others since Wells himself takes an alarmist point of view. (An alarmist is someone who exaggerates danger in order to ensue panic. Despite the exaggeration, alarmists are necessary in situations where individuals are stubborn about their beliefs about climate change despite climate change being very real--but I digress). 
           <br><br>
However, Wells has other major points of his article that give off a much more realistic perspective as opposed to his notorious alarmist perspective. For example, Wells states "We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate; by most estimates, at least ten times faster. The rate is accelerating." I appreciate more approachable details such as this because it ensures a better understanding among his audience.
           <br><br>

Overall, I think that because Wells' take on expressing climate change is more emotionally charged, his message won't be as well received as other articles because he mainly focuses on the negative. Which can implant a mindset of "well, if the world is already going downhill almost to the point of no return, we should just let it happen". I think that if he focused on a more positive approach towards his alarmist article, Wells could resonate with a wider audience.

After reading the article by David Wallace, I have a more comprehensive understanding of how climate change will affect the world around us with scientific support. Before reading this article, I watched some independent documentary about climate change. The story was about the famine around the equator. It corresponds with one of the sections in the article “ The End of Food.” The reading provides us data, scientific research, and prediction about the future. The data is horrifying. Twenty million people could be killed this year in Africa and the Middle East if humans continue harming the environment that we inhabit on. 
           <br><br>

As someone who grew up in Beijing with the experience of “airpocalypse,” I had a strong feeling about the section of the Unbreathable Air. I still remember as a student, the school would cancel the outdoor PE class, and we stay in the classroom to do homework; the scene that almost everyone was wearing a mask on the street; the sunlight was rarely can be seen through the smog and haze, and also the bad smell of fumes in the air. 
           <br><br>

Other results of climate change are more like a chain reaction; the perpetual war and economic collapse will all eventually harm humans themselves. According to Wallace, there is no program alone can prevent such climate disaster, so it is curial for every one of us to realize the issues we are facing now and act upon it.

<p>
Before reading the article, I thought I knew what I was going to hear from Mr. David Wells, but it turns out that I was wrong. The article did not just repeat the facts scientists had found, but I was wrong. Unlike other articles and documentaries I’ve watched before, Mr. Wells isn’t demanding any specific action, but rather encourage us to see the problems we are going to face and find the solution ourselves. Mr. Wells paints a picture for the reader, he laid out a blueprint that showed us where our problems really came from and why we should care and put into action immediately to solve the crisis of climate change. 
           <br><br>

In my opinion, Mr. David Wells  would be an alarmist, but I don't find the article to be frightened, in fact I find it to be truthful and on-point. It made me feel that we have to take responsibility and deal with the crisis instead of running away from it or ignoring it, like what Mr. Wells says, “Now we’ve found a way to engineer our own doomsday, and surely we will find a way to engineer our way out of it, one way or another.” After all, we made huge contribution for Earth to become the way it is today.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells was honestly n informative read despite being "alarmist" in nature. I have quoted the word alarmist because of the fact that alarmist articles have the intention of creating needless panic through the over exaggeration of a problem. Though I do believe Wallace was describing the worst case scenario, an example being an entire 12 degree rise in heat, I also believe it is entirely necessary to scare readers into doing their part in making a change, whether on a large scale or in their daily lives. After all, the problem has persisted over decades and most methods to counter climate change have been to no avail. A characteristic of the article I did enjoy was his thoroughness of the subject. He delved into the topic of inevitable war and economic collapse, and I believe that is wholly necessary when informing a group of readers potentially uneducated in this subject.  Seeing how climate change can affect our future in so many ways makes this problem an even realer issue to the reader and might spurt the change this planet so desperately needs. In conclusion, while I can see why this article could be interpreted as "alarmist" in nature, I do not believe so personally because of the fact that these are entirely possible scenarios that might one day become our future, and his alarming tone is meant to prompt change rather than needless panic.

The quote that really struck me quite hard was “the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years.” We have had sharp activity in our temperature before and we are in the middle of another one in our lifetime. Before taking this course at UCSB, I came in with a mindset more towards the “not so convinced” side of the spectrum of belief. I believe in God and was raised around people and family members with similar beliefs. When I would hear the words “climate change” growing up, I thought to myself: “Of course. The climate does indeed change and it can get quite extreme. Think about the Ice Age”  I believe this was the same mindset of those around me which made it difficult for me to feel comfortable to differ from. When my eyes read over this quote, I was reminded of my original quota that I would go to. I wonder if I truly deep down thought it was God’s plan for climate change to become so destructive and this was my way of telling myself we will all make it out okay. 
           <br><br>


This reading was a wide awakening for me. A round of applause goes out to Ken for picking this as our reading for our very first assignment. How alarming is it that in just ten years from now our reality can be so very different from what we are used to. I now see the signs. I see the odd weather patterns that slowly made their way into my reality. I see the flooding. I see the heat waves torturing the homeless. Tornado warnings in Orange County were not a thing I thought I would ever have to worry about in my lifetime! It is all very odd but it all has an answer. I am excited for where this course will lead my beliefs. 
           <br><br>
In the Heat Death section, I was reminded that an average increase in global temperature of 2 degrees Celsius is calculated by - you guessed it - an average, meaning it could be as little as 0 degrees in some places and maybe 7 degrees in other places. While there may be no changes in some areas, the wet tropics that have heat-trapping rain clouds could experience heat death for many species. And this is celsius! That is a whopping 35.6 degrees Fahrenheit which is an even scarier thing to think about. If you want to target more Americans to think of their contribution to climate change, advertise the average rise in temperature in Fahrenheit for them to understand the weight of this change. 
           <br><br>
The use of the 2002 heatwave killing 2,000 people in Paris was an incredible analogy to use as what could become a normal summer. 
           <br><br>


As far as the war projections, I find it hard to try and say we might have an increase in more war. So many countries are to blame for contributing to the problem to begin with that it seems quite impossible to have one target, doesn’t it?

David Wallace-Wells' article "The Uninhabitable Earth" was quite alarming but intriguing. Wells, in my point of view, really raised awareness by listing many consequences that are resulting from the way we conduct our lives. Personally, I didn't think of any consequences beyond 'heat death' and 'the end of food'; the article was very informative on how many more consequences climate change can bring about in our world. Although the consequences might have been meant to startle us, it  brings about more awareness on the many effects and impact in our environment. Wells did list the worst possible outcomes, but used what is happening in the now as evidence to what the future conditions of our world will be like; this dims down the controversy that 'everything is unlikely to happen'. 
           <br><br>
I found 'the end of food' most compelling because we do rely on many places, those that are more likely to experience extreme drought, to supply much of the world's food. Also, starvation and undernourishment are common issues we hear about today and Wells' mention that about " 800 million globally" will experience undernourishment is quite alarming information. Although I found the 'end of food' most compelling, all other consequences were just as alarming. Reading this article made me realize that the information I knew regarding climate change was very superficial and has motivated me to share the importance of the issue.

As I sit, mesmerized by a picturesque blue sky and even bluer ocean just outside my window, it is hard to believe Wallace-Wells’s anxiety-inducing claims grounded in his article, “The Uninhabitable Earth”.  And yet, that is the major apparent problem with society today: the big picture is hard to see.  Just like me, many people see beautiful things and feel like in the moment everything is okay.  But in reality, tiny changes over time have caused big effects that beg to be seen.  Even just outside my window it is apparent: the clear sky that should be bringing rain clouds in this time of year, the oddly high tide of the lovely ocean in the winter.  These are all symptoms of the climate change Wallace-Wells is referring to, but on a much smaller scale, because it is happening in everyone’s backyard—not just mine.  

           <br><br>

I think it would be uneducated to completely dismiss Wallace-Wells’s article as alarmist.  Though much of what he is talking about is supposition on our future, I believe that the panic the article creates is exactly what we need to avoid what he had described. Sometimes it is hard to understand that every action each of us takes makes a difference, despite knowing that our mass industrialization has affected the balance of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere—the beginning of a host of terrifying problems.  The facts are undeniable.  It was interesting to me that Wallace-Wells even addressed the economic effects our ignorance could bring, noting that “there is a 12 percent chance that climate change will reduce global output by more than 50 percent by 2100” (Wallace-Wells).  By mentioning economic distress and a rise in violence, it catches the attention of even those who otherwise would not have cared.  Wallace-Wells’s call to action is essential to the survival of not just humans, but Earth’s ecosystem as we know it.

This is actually my second time reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells and although he has a very depressing slap in the face tactic I think it works. I do not think that calling David Wallace-Wells an alarmist is not very fitting because the definition of an alarmist states that someone is exaggerating a danger subsequently causing unnecessary worry. I think Wallace’s urgency and frightful article is very reasonable because our planet is perishing and we NEED to do something about it. If his article leaves people scared then I think that is good because those people won’t be able to ignore the reality they have been shielding themselves from. there will always be people who will shy away from articles like this because they’re too upsetting, but to me, that just proves they’re real, and they are relevant. When I first read the article I remember being horrified at the fact that the permafrost in the Arctic was starting to melt. Not only was this thought alarming because it meant global temperatures were rising so much that the “Permanent” Frost began melting…the only thing making that worse is all of the carbon dioxide trapped inside the ice that if it escapes will destroy our atmosphere along with potential unknown things that could be trapped along with the carbon dioxide.

I agree, since the article was very depressing, it took me a while to get through it, but the points made are very alarming. I strongly agree with your point about how the uneasy feeling this article gives justifies that it is real. The points do stay on your mind and open your eyes to things that one may have never thought about. This could make people think twice about what they are doing and encourage them to make better decisions, especially since the article lets us know that we are harming other ecosystems such as the ones in the ocean. In that specific part of the article, (Part VIII), the point made that said, "when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans' pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death." really stood out to me because it just shows how bad the state of ocean is. I think that it is really sad that our actions are causing damage to the nature around us. But like you said, this "depressing slap in the face" really does showcase the urgency of something needing to be be done and that the devastating consequences should not be avoided.

Upon reading David Wallace Wells',  "The Uninhabitable Earth",  I found myself overcome with a wave of anxiousness. I had plenty of knowledge on the topic prior, but Wells delves in on a whole other level. His stance is not that of an alarmist, but rather a realist. Rather than simply stating the possible consequences of climate change, he explains each possibility in a multitude of layers, as well as provides an in depth description of what would need to be done to prevent each of the possible outcomes. Along with this, he provides causation for each possible event. 
           <br><br>
Of all the events described, I find that the melting of permafrost is the most concerning. Along with the millions of tons of CO2 we pump into the atmosphere each year, we now have to worry about carbon being thawed from this permafrost due to the worlds increase in heat. This carbon may evaporate as methane, which is a far more powerful gas than carbon. 
           <br><br>
The scenarios Well's paints are not those of a distant fiction, but rather very real possibilities that we as a species need to accept. This article is a call to action. Although it instills a sense of fear, it is not meant to freeze you in your place. It is crying out for a difference. We already have clear evidence of how our actions as humans effects the world. The past 5 years are the hottest ever recorded on Earth. In the last year over $100 billion was spent on climate disasters. Arctic ice has dropped 13%. Although the picture painted in this article isn't pretty, it could very well become our reality in a not-too-distant future. Well's is providing the reader with all of the ammunition needed to take down this enemy we call climate change; all we need to do is use it.

When I began reading the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I was not expecting to be so shocked at what I would discover. I previously had believed, probably like many other people, that I had a decent understanding of how dangerous climate change actually is. I was quickly proven wrong when I read the first paragraph and noticed how genuinely shocked I was at the information I was reading. I thought to myself, “it can’t be this bad”, and, “how did I not know this?”, which showed me how much of a true understanding I have of the climate crisis. I immediately could not wait to read more and as I was reading, I was getting more and more frightened at the severity of climate change. 
           <br><br>

Scaring the reader might be one of the main points in this article, which isn’t a bad approach in my opinion to raise awareness. Professor Hiltner mentions that in this video that the author may have been trying to “frighten us into action”, which is a great strategy to bring attention to this topic. By naming the very first section  “Doomsday” it entices the audience to read more and get hit with the very alarming facts very quickly so that they want to read more about the issue of climate change. 
           <br><br>

One of the scariest facts that were brought up in the reading, to me, was that there had previously been five mass extinctions on Earth and one those extinctions was caused by a very similar situation that humans are facing right now. The previous mass extinction was referring to when the excess amount of carbon caused the Earth to warm five degrees, which created the release of methane in the arctic, killing 97% of all life on Earth. Wallace-Wells ends his article by illustrating that many humans will begin to normalize the crisis and eventually we will start calling natural disasters “weather”. But, he also ends very optimistic, stating that if we created this problem then we can certainly save ourselves from it. By sharing these harsh realities, the author provokes the audience to hopefully want to take action to save our planet.

I felt the exact same way when I was reading the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth" and realized how much I was actually underestimating the dangers of climate change. I thought I knew what was going on just by simply watching the news, but Wallace-Wells has made me realize that the problem is much more than just no breathable air and polar icecaps melting. It is not just about how much carbon dioxide is in the air, it is about much our civilization is abusing our resources and not realizing what 1.5 degrees Celsius can actually do to us and our home.
           <br><br>


I do agree too that the tactic of scaring the reader into understanding the problem is not a bad approach. It makes sense to create titles such as "The Uninhabitable Earth" and "Doomsday" in order to get the reader's attention and see how dire the situation really is. Another point is how Wallace-Wells even mentions how conservative some researchers are with sharing the worrying information because they do not want to scare the public. But the only way to overcome everyone's ignorance is to show the horrifying truth, the blunt and horrifying truth.
<br><Hr>

I am in the same boat as you when reading the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells. I was also not expecting to be surprised regarding the argument of the text. Like you, I also have a decent understanding of what Climate Change because in the last 2 decades, it has been the number one issue that society has tackled. Although, It is true that Wallace-Wells is naturally scaring the reader to portray his claims regarding Climate Change.Wallace-Wells successfully crafted the article to highlight the call to do something regarding Climate Change based on the facts and research by naming the first section "Doomsday" to not just simply entice the audience but also to remind them that this is an ongoing issue that we as society is currently experiencing as I write this comment. Hence if we do not do act regarding Climate Change, the word "Doomsday" as mentioned in the article, will eventually occur.
           <br><br>

Lastly, I have the same reactions with you regarding the five mass extinctions. Notably, the release of methane in the arctic due to Global warming, killing 97% of all life on Earth. I find that really alarming because it shows a similarity of excess amount of carbon causing the Earth to warm in small degrees, that we might think it doesn't really affect the environment, but in reality, It is a drastic change. The five mass extinctions on Earth is truly causing a very similar situation that humanity is facing right now. Thus, implying that History will repeat itself if we do not do something about it.
<br><Hr>

While reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I can agree that the depth of the issue shocked me. While reading just the first section, "Doomsday," I was not only put on alert by the sheer severity that word holds, but also the double meaning in terms of talking about the "Doomsday" vault, which was built to store food in case of any catastrophe, and had flooded a mere ten years later. This really caught my attention as it shows how quickly the temperatures are changing, and how it's faster than anyone had thought initially. As the article stated, the Arctic permafrost melting has a due date that keeps getting closer, meaning no one can foresee how swiftly the climate is changing. This made me think about all the times people say that the climate will be irreversibly damaged by a certain year, and how those dates are probably all wrong now. 

           <br><br>

When it came to the point about the five mass extinctions, I was tipped off by the sentence that read: "The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now." This is definitely put there to catch the reader's attention, as aforementioned in the previous comment, this is a scare tactic used to cause action. The fact that we are all living, some people still denying the fact that climate change exists, let alone is a crisis at this level, is baffling. The most worrisome part to me is the connection again with the melting Arctic, and all the carbon dioxide that is trapped and is far too close to melting. What I didn't understand is how remarkably similar what we're living through right now was to the last time 97% of life on Earth died.
<br><Hr>
I had a very similar experience reading this article. I think just the shear weight of Wallace-Wells using current facts to create credibility and projecting a future based off of them, makes me believe his points and feel anxious about reversing our current violence to this planet. Most of my information and sourcing comes from activists accounts on social media, which I share out often; so I too felt like I was in the loop about climate change. But, reading this article alone, I see that I, and probably a majority of the U.S. public, have not seen the true crisis in mainstream media. This, in itself, is a problem. Our mainstream news outlets are constantly pumping out stories about politics, technology, and the economy, which although are components to climate change, ignoring the immediate threat of our planet on the brink of another mass extinction. 
           <br><br>
This article is the first time I have heard about terms like scientific reticence, the albedo effect, Anthropocene, ocean acidification, and the environmental uncanny. The section which most surprised me however was the "Unbreathable Air" portion. Especially being a senior in SB, and already having experienced two major fires in the area, it makes the situation feel so much more real. To know that, given conditions continue to worsen, our cognitive ability can decline by 1/5 in function and our life span will be cut by ten years; I would imagine that more people would be concerned and looking to make a difference. 
           <br><br>
This leads me to question Wallace-Wells' use of alarmism. Personally, reading all these horrific facts and projected futures/outcomes scared the BLANK out of me. To realize that we are scheduled for a mass extinction is a huge jump from what I previously thought the consequences of climate change were. However, I was disappointed that Wallace-Wells simply ended the article with wish-washy solutions of basically summarizing other scientists' ideal predictions, after such a heavy and ramped up call to action. I think he does a good job in using credible fear to call the audience into action, which personally leaves me feeling overwhelmed mostly due to him falling short in providing solutions or small ways in which a reader can hope to play a part in reversing climate change. Because of this, I feel some readers may critique Wallace-Wells for just being alarmist; but however the case, I think the article has so much to learn from, as probably 85% of the information was new to me and probably for others too.

<br><Hr>
I also agree that I was really shocked when I first started reading the article. I've known climate change has been an issue, but I wasn't aware that there is so much contributing to this issue. If anything I feel like mainstream media under exaggerates how bad the climate has gotten. I also agree that Wallace used intimidation to scare us in to really listening to what he had to say, but I think that it's a great tactic because not only am I learning new information, but I'm also being filled with this urgency to jump out of bed and do something about it. The fact that there have been five mass exctinctions, and one with conditions similar to what we're facing now, is extremely stressful.

I think an alarmist approach as a call to action in the crisis of climate change can be a slippery slope. Everyone is going to react differently to the information they are hearing. Some may become frozen with fear and sadness, unable to wrap their minds around the magnitude of the issue at hand. Some may immediately jump into panic mode and want to get involved in every way they can. It is hard to predict how people are going to react. In my case, as a second year environmental major, I felt a mixture of these two reactions. Yes, I do want to cry and break down in fear, but I also feel proud to be an ES major so that I can help make a difference. This article reminds me of all the reasons that I want to be an ES major and all of the problems this world has that need fixing.

In his article, David Wallace Wells approaches climate change not just by informing readers with statistics and facts, but by painting a picture of what he believes our future is scheduled for. I think Wells certainly is an alarmist and that his approach describing climate change’s far reaching effects can be both overwhelming but also strategic in reaching a broader audience. Wallace’s lengthy article listing out the many different and specific effects of climate change that will likely happen as a result of our human actions makes it hard to think of climate change as something that we can all focus up on and change. It makes the mind wander and unable to focus on a single action plan. On the other hand, Wallace Well is strategic in covering all the bases of possible concerns various people might have. By sectioning out his article by issue, he is able to communicate to different audiences' who may be compelled to act based on the different things they are passionate about. (i.e disease,  warfare, economics). 


           <br><br>
When I finished reading the article, I felt almost tired and disappointed, but strangely indifferent as well. It’s disheartening to see that our actions as a global civilization have led us so quickly to the point we are at today, and it makes me frustrated that there aren’t heavier regulations on what large corporations and countries have been able to get away with. The concern that I’ve seen directly the most is the unbreathable air. As a UCSB student during the Thomas fires and as a NorCal resident that has seen a large increase in the number of fires over the past decade growing up, I think worsening air quality is certainly something to look out for because it's something that I've been directly affect by.  I feel indifferent because the other reasons are so far away from me that the thought of them not affecting me makes me not believe that they are as prevalent, even though they are. Also, I also feel that I don’t know the proper channels and organizations to work with or donate to in order to help. It would have been helpful if the article gave us a well established organization that we could support at the end. Additionally, I felt that a lot of Wallace Well’s concerns were a little imaginative or speculative. For instance, I am not fully convinced that mutated viruses trapped in ice will resurface. Even if this might be the case, I would like to see well established research on this before believing that this may become an issue. 
           <br><br>
Overall, I felt like Wallace Well’s article showed passion and tried its best to reach a large audience.

I had to read this article last quarter for my Environmental Studies 1 class. In all honesty the first time I read it, I sort of questioned how anyone, anywhere could have any hope for the climate crisis. I mean sea level rise was already concerning enough, but with Wells adding a slew of other multi-layered incomprehensible problems, the issue seemed hopeless. I remember finishing the article and sort of scoffing at the notion that humans will solve the issue of climate change "because we must" or because these old climatologists said we will simply because humans are humans. However, upon my second reading, I felt a little bit of hope wash over me reading that ending. Sure, geoengineering solutions are nowhere near a silver bullet, firstly because a lot of them are theoretical or are not nearly at the scale required, or because they simply do not take in to account the other horrible symptoms of climate change. For example, using aerosols in the stratosphere is likely going to lock us into the solution forever (ie we cannot stop spraying or climate change will become an issue all over again), it will not take CO2 out of the atmosphere, it causes other issues like acid rain, and it fails to address ocean acidification. And as incomplete as these solutions may be, I still find hope.

           <br><br>

I think its because after reading, watching, talking, writing, posting, liking, and upvoting a zillion and one things about climate change everyday, I have realized that you cannot let the doom take control of you. Worst case scenario (and at this point probably the most likely) climate change is going to absolutely devastate us. No one is rushing to make any changes so I am calling the issue as I see it. However, even if the climate fight is unwinnable one, I still want to go down on the battle field. I want to die knowing that when the entire planet was at stake, that I was there, caring, acting, and not shying away from a seemingly impossible task. It of course sounds foolish, but no matter what, I can either take solace in the fact that I fought the good fight, or that I was one the people that made the victory possible if some how humanity joins together and miraculously tames or least limits climate change.

           <br><br>

I appreciate Wells greatly for this article. I think people need a serious wake up call in terms of what climate change means for the future of humanity and what we can at least attempt to comprehend as the future conditions of our beloved home. I feel like that upon my second read, I have taken away the message that Wells intended: To of course be afraid, but not paralyzed by fear, but rather ready to act as if ones life depends on it, because it does.

David Wallace-Wells alarmed that people do not regard climate change as a serious issue, and he listed many severe consequences of climate change which ignored and understated by scientists. For instance, he pointed out that air will be unbreathable, because higher temperature will lead to more ozone forms which are quite harmful to people’s respiratory system. Also higher temperature means that there is more heat, human need to exhale extra heat to survive, if the surrounding temperature is too high, human will get disease and die, because the heat in their body can not get out. Moreover, higher temperature will result in decline of food production. The higher temperature is, the fewer crops yield. Therefore, the temperature will keep rising, and food production will reduce, but population is still increasing. I think it is a important problem about which people should think. Additionally, there are plagues which stored in Arctic ice. Human’s immune system can not deal with them, and if they are released, there will be many people die. Furthermore, climate change not only impacts on ice, but it also influences on water. It leads to ocean acidification, and many corals died because of the decline of PH. As a consequence, many fishes died since they feed on coral. David Wallace-Wells mentioned some solutions which sound plausible to solve climate change. For example, he highlighted Wally Broecker proposed that disperse sulfur dioxide into atmosphere, and it will form sulfuric acid, and it will reflect 2% solar insolation. However, it will cause more acid rain. In fact, there are many solutions which are just break down the big problem into smaller problems.
             <br><br>
   In my perspective, most of his article is trustworthy. He may just exaggerates some facts to trigger our attention to the serious problem. In a word, I believe what he underscored are taking place, and if we don’t take action, human will go to extinction in the future.

The article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” explains the consequences of what our inaction will do to the earth and to ourselves. The reality that the article portrays is terrifying to consider when we realize that not everyone is willing to accept that this is actually occurring. The complete denial or the downplay of the sixth mass extinction that is currently occurring is drastically limiting what can be done to slow it down. By not acknowledging it or not paying enough attention to the climate crisis that is currently occurring, no real drastic change can be made. 
             <br><br>

The article also points out that a lot of the wars and displacement that we have seen in the past few years are a result of the climate crisis. The civil war that occurred in Syria partly because of a drought occurring during this time also led to the forced displacement of 6.5 million people. Researchers Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang note that, “For every half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict.” A rise in conflict will also see a rise in the displacement of people wanting to flee that conflict. There will also be a displacement of people who have lost their homes due to the rise of sea levels and the loss of crops due to droughts or fires.
             <br><br>

David Wallace-Wells method of creating a panic among readers is effective and does not make him an alarmist. He presents the research that he used in his article and does not downplay the effects of what is occurring and what will continue to occur, unlike much of the information that has been presented to us in our lifetime. As he points out, 85% of the carbon dioxide that has been released into our atmosphere has occurred since World War II. Since then, the drastic changes in climate have occurred in our lifetimes. In California alone, the hottest and driest summers have occurred in the last twenty years. Six of the ten most destructive fires have occurred in California in the past three years. When we consider the destruction that has already occurred, we need to understand that we are not prepared for the events that are to come.

I completely agree with your statement about Wallace-Well not being an alarmist but rather he is acting on research he has collected and reporting his findings. I consider his actions to be an act of civic duty because he is shedding light on the possible events that will occur if humans do not agree that climate crisis is real and something which should be dealt with immediately. He calls for urgency in the matter because if we fail to address it, we will no longer have a future to look forwards to.

“ The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was a read straight out of a Hollywood horror movie, to be honest. Not because of his writing, but because it painted a picture of climate change a lot worse than mainstream media. We all learned in school that the Earth is going to heat up, ice will melt and several cities will go underwater, etc. However, war? Economic collapse? He is, in essence, calling climate change this century’s mass extinction, and what makes the scenario so terrifying is that it’s true. 

             <br><br>



Wallace-Wells paints a traumatizing picture, but that’s exactly what I enjoyed most about this article; he doesn’t pretend we have a problem that can be dealt with in a little bit, he calls people to act now before it’s too late. Even if someone doesn’t care about the environment itself, he shows that there is a lot more at stake: our lifestyles, our culture, and life itself.

While David Wallace-Wells does take on an alarmist tone in “The Uninhabitable Earth”, the conclusions he has reached are not unreasonable, especially in the event that carbon emissions continue rising at its current rate and tangible changes around the world aren’t made. His sensationalist approach is necessary to drive people into action. The discouraging predictions he has made are not set in stone - there is still time to reduce our carbon emissions and slow the effects of climate change, but the world needs to step up now, or in the near future, to combat the climate crisis. 
             <br><br>
It seems as though on a societal scale, we have become desensitized to the massive threat that climate change actually poses. For instance, the Australia bushfires have been burning for a few months and have only recently been receiving the media attention it deserves. Although natural disasters in recent events have been occurring on larger scales than ever before, people are less shocked each time they occur, and seemingly less inclined to do something about them. We have become desensitized. It is easy to overlook the long-term consequences of consumerist practices because they provide short-term fulfillment, but Wallace-Wells gives a realistic picture of what our world would become if we remain complacent and allow those who profit in the face of climate change to continue their harmful practices undeterred.
             <br><br>
One of the arguments I found particularly effective in this article was how society itself would unravel from perpetual war and permanent economic collapse. The damage done to the environment is undoubtedly the most prominent issue with continued greenhouse gas emissions - long-term ramifications such as a lack of food for a growing population, poisoned oceans, rising temperatures, unbreathable smog, and even the revival of diseases from the past (such as smallpox and the bubonic plague) would have a deadly impact on millions of species. But in addition to this, climate change also has the potential to bring out the worst in humanity; rising temperatures positively correlates to an increase in crime and higher economic costs. Ultimately, Wallace-Wells wrote a wake-up call to society about the unforeseeable consequences that climate change will bring, unless we start making changes now.

I had very similar thoughts on Wallace-Wells' article. It's quite impossible to have an honest and realistic discussion of climate change without being alarmist or pessimistic because that is the only way the truth about perhaps the most pressing issue can be conveyed. Something that he emphasizes in his article is how although many are oblivious to the sheer intensity of the issue of climate change and fail to understand it as a disaster, the world will soon not permit such ignorance because of the conditions coming in the near future. This is similar to what you mentioned about much of the population being desensitized to the harsh reality of climate change. They see it as not a problem or a problem of the future, when that is not the case. 
             <br><br>

He highlights a myriad of serious issues that climate change will entail and is already causing such as, polluted unbreathable air, economic collapse, poisonous oceans, perpetual war, mass extinction leading to ecological crises,  permafrost, disease mutations, food scarcity, death by heat, and even more. A lot of these severe problems are typically neglected or forgotten in many discussions of climate change. Another thing that is often neglected in such discussions, is who climate change will hurt the most, and that is poorer people and poorer countries. I believe that is part of the reason why powerful and wealthy people and countries don't treat climate change as an actual issue, because they don't see it as an issue that will harm them specifically (even though at one point it is likely that all life on Earth will be at risk). But unfortunately, it is powerful and wealthy people/countries who accelerate climate change the most, and are the most capable of attempts to curtail it as a result (which are often minimal if there are any). This makes the issue of climate change even more threatening since there are not much aggressive approaches to curtail it being taken.

While I was reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I think that what he said in his article is more specific and thought-provoking than other environmental films and readings that I have read. Usually, the articles will stop with the conclusion that global warming will result in sea level rising or economic crisis. David Wallace furthered his articles by throwing out harsh predictions of how environmental change will deeply influence human life and, even, the entire civilization. For example, he mentioned in the Poisoned Ocean that the hydrogen sulfide will kill 97percent of all life if “all the feedback loops had been triggered and the circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt.” I believe that stating these harsh predictions is also the reason why this article is controversial since it can easily cause panic, but I hope that this is the reason why more and more people start to change and act differently so that these harsh predictions won’t become harsh truths.

I also found this article different from others that I have read and even just what I have heard through people and what I have been taught. We all heard about the sea-level rising and the glaciers melting, but there is so much more that is possible than that. As if that weren't severe enough. When I read about diseases coming back from millions of years ago that was the most alarming. I had never heard of that and never thought of that as a possibility, and it has already happened which I am surprised I never heard of.  Reading the article made me feel almost hopeless,  there is so many effects of climate change, how can we even recover? Personally I liked the article because of all that I learned, but I thought it felt so pessimistic, he stated everything that could go wrong but not how we could change it, he offered no solution as if we were already doomed.

Shock therapy packs a neat punch in this rough cut break-down of our planet's future. The grim reality to which David Wallace-Wells predicts, "No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent..." has been ignored, ridiculed, and rejected. Thus, crucial time has been wasted trying to convince the naive of what is happening right before us, instead of using these precious moments to be proactive in finding solutions. Associating Wells with the word "alarmist" is ironic in the fact that it implies he is dramatic and extreme in his depictions, yet those who view him as an alarmist actively ignore the glaringly extreme reality of the planet. There is no longer time for neatly packaged conversations and fingers-crossed approaches to public awareness. An aggressively forthright, this-is-what's-happening method, such as that which Wells expertly displays in his article, is our only option, and a last ditch effort to shake awake the many still in denial.

             <br><br>

The topics of this article and the depth in which he discusses them is alarming to say the least, but it's the most effective way of evoking a sense of urgency. I personally was never a very environmentally conscious individual and had little interest in the state of our planet. I didn't see it happening with my own eyes and that was enough to placate me. David Wallace-Wells sees this complacency on a universal level and so uses scare tactics to rattle us into action. These abrasive and painful truths are only the beginning of what's to come, and our Earth may not survive if we don't act collectively and immediately.
              <br><br>

Aside from Wells' specific writing tactics, I found the content itself absolutely shocking. Most if not all of the facts mentioned I knew nothing about. I obviously take responsibility for my own knowledge, or lack thereof, however, the sore absence of media attention, news coverage, and general discussion of the severity of our climate crisis is astounding. We live with our heads in the sand and wonder why we can't breathe. Earthquakes are pulverizing parts of Puerto Rico, apocalyptic fires are killing millions of animals in Australia, the Amazon is being burned, cut down, and destroyed right before us. All of this happening every second of now, and most of us go about our day without a single thought to the climate crisis, and then have the audacity to be shocked when human catalyzed disasters strike.

In the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells there was a voice of concern and emergency to get the reader to understand the importance of the consequences of climate change. I believe that Wallace shouldn’t be considered an alarmist because he is simply stating, with hard evidence, some possibilities on what could happen to humans and the earth if there’s isn't a call for action right now to fight climate change. Throughout the article, Wallace had some statements that really stood out to me. For example, one statement was, “But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough”. I was really happy when I read this sentence because it is true. A good proportion of us know that there is a climate crisis occurring right now, yet I feel like we’re not doing enough to protect our planet. We need to be more loud and present so people in power can help and influence the nation together as a whole to move towards more environmentally friendly actions and/or pass policies to help the planet. At the same time, when I read this sentence I felt called out as well. I thought I knew enough about global warming and the effects it will leave behind, however I didn’t. Something new I learned that was surprising to me was that there are frozen diseases and bugs trapped in the Arctic ice waiting to get release once the ice melts. It is a terrifying idea that one day diseases such as smallpox and bubonic plague can come back and infect/kill many people. This fact alone should be alarming enough for people to pay attention to climate change and start acting. That’s why I think Wallace’s article is not extreme, it is exactly what we need so people can wake up and realize that this is not a hoax.

I definitely agree with you about Wells's line of “But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough”. I would definitely say that this statement rings true for most people reading the article, even if they are already switching to more sustainable ways of living and conserving resources to help the environment. I had gone into reading this article knowing about the high carbon levels and pollution emitted from burning fossil fuels. I had known about he giant hole in our ozone layer.  I had also known about the coral bleaching that is happening all over the world. However, the details that Wells's presents in about each degree of warming are alarming, like you mentioned releases deadly diseases of smallpox and bubonic plague that could reappear as an epidemic once exposed. I agree that Well's article is not too extreme, and it is actually a wake up call that many of us need. 
              <br><br>
I do think that we need to be more loud and take more action into actually helping the environment, instead of just coming up with ways to help and then failing when the policy change is blocked. 
              <br><br>
I hope that others that read the article will have learnt more about the alarming, but relevant and necessary facts about climate change. And along with reading it, change some of their daily habits to help with the crisis.
               <br><br>
I do think that each generation has a responsibility, at this stage, to help resolve the crisis, as Earth's environment is a place that we all live on and share. Especially with the wildlife, we need to consider that we are not the only species inhabiting this planet, and if we want to continue to inhabit this planet, we need to really work together and clean up the mess that we made.

Climate change is a pressing issue in today's society.  After reading the article along with the videos, the issue was made much more alarming to me.  David Wallace-Wells is said to be an alarmist for his warnings about climate change.  In all reality, Wells is quite the opposite.  Wells intends to somewhat frighten his audience in this serious matter because climate change is not an issue that will ultimately disappear if no changes are being made.  Climate change is a very real issue and by viewing someone who warns us about this issue as an alarmist, shows that many people in today's society don't take the matter seriously.  By not being directly affected by climate change in the present time many people choose to brush the issue off, not realizing that its future impacts are catastrophic.

David Wallace-Wells article is exactly what one would expect when you first read the title; an uninhabitable earth. We are living on a planet in which we will no longer be able to live on due to the numerous catastrophes that have already taken place and are going to continue to take place if something doesn't get done. Wallace-Wells makes it a point to go beyond the general information that any one should already know about the damages and potential damages that can occur. He goes far beyond than just letting us know that the earth is warming. Far beyond letting us know that ocean level is rising. Far beyond letting us know that our earth is on fire. Don't get me wrong, these issues are very serious and should never be looked passed but there are a lot more other damaging events that are occuring that many do not know of. He presents us with the harsh reality that many do not want to hear about for whatever reason that might be. He educates us on mass extinctions, decline in agriculture activity, plagues emerging from ice, wars that break out, etc.. all due to global warming. He provides us with evidence such as statistics, interviews with scientists, and what is expected for our future. He does this all in such a harsh manner in which one would agree that he is taking an “alarmist approach.” In my opinion, I believe that this alarmist approach is very necessary for such a serious issue. Everything said in his article should be alarming because it is the harsh truth. Many people might not agree with this approach because it can frighten people, but what other way would one attack this? There is nothing comforting about our climate crisis. When you think about climate change, one does not necessarily think happy thoughts. What is so comforting about our earth dying? Nothing. Being scared of global warming is completely normal, but that shouldn't make us run away from it. If anything it should make one want to tackle the problem so we and future generations can live in a healthy sustainable earth.

The picture painted by David Wallace-Wells is not only an accurate depiction of where the world may be headed if humans do not take substantial action to reverse climate change, but also a very scary idea to imagine. The devastation Wallace-Wells describes, such as the melting of Arctic permafrost and releasing of 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, is truly terrifying. The world, as is, is already rapidly increasing in temperature due to the ever-increasing rise of atmospheric carbon-dioxide, resulting in dangerous changes around the globe. One can only imagine the devastation that will result from the melting of Arctic permafrost, since its carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times more powerful of a greenhouse-gas warming blanket than carbon-dioxide. Wallace-Wells states that as is, the world is already set to lose Miami and Bangladesh before 2100, and that is even without the climate crisis worsening. 

               <br><br>

Scientists project the world will experience four to eight degrees of warming by the next century. This is extremely alarming because the last time the world was four degrees warmer, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher than they are presently, as mentioned by Peter Brannen, author of "The Ends of the World". Scientists also point out that in the five previous mass extinctions, the cause was climate change from carbon emissions. The world is warming much faster than it did during those previous mass extinctions.

               <br><br>

This is truly terrifying me. I pray to God that our politicians take sweeping actions to correct global warming. I am going to continue to act. I will vow to vote for politicians that support environmental efforts, including the Green New Deal. I will continue to march in the Sunrise Movement marches. I will consider going vegan again.
               <br><br>


Wallace-Wells is not an alarmist in my opinion, because he is not intentionally trying to scare people for no reason. He is just painting a real picture of how the world could end up if humans do not act to correct climate change. The science is there, and the evidence is clear. We need to act to fix this problem we, the human race, have created.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells provided a rather grim look at the current state of our climate crisis and its possible outcomes if little is done to respond to the crisis. He illustrates and maps out various visions of the oncoming apocalypse caused by inaction and continued disregard for the planet. However, before considering Wallace-Wells alarmist, one should consider the fact that he mentions that these scenarios could materialize if no action is taken. I have enough faith in humanity to believe that even the politicians and lobbyists on Capitol Hill would support some kind of innovation or cause as they begin to realize the vast destruction of their precious capitalistic system brought upon by the forces of nature. Despite this pessimistic look (or optimistic, depending on how you view it), better late than never
               <br><br>

In addition, two scenarios in the article stood out to me most: Climate Plagues and The Great Filter. Climate Plagues was a surprising read for me and the one that terrified me most because it sounded like something straight out of a good science fiction movie.  I also had never heard of this scenario before or even considered this possible. However, I do appreciate the fact that Wallace-Wells considers this scenario somewhat unlikely considering previous research. The Great Filter is kind of terrifying to me because it ultimately means that intelligent life and civilizations have a set lifetime, and that destruction is inevitable. I have always acknowledged the inevitability of death, but to see it written out in such a broad sense was eye-opening. At this point, I have accepted the fact that the planet is pretty much doomed if our leaders continue to refuse to act and acknowledge that we are killing the Earth. However, I am confident that on the course of our destruction, we will act towards the goal of preventing the vastness of any of the scenarios presented by Wallace-Wells.

<p>
To be honest, global warming has not been a new topic. Like melting glaciers rises water levels, the inundation of villages which force villagers to leave. We have heard about it for a long time. But we still have an indifferent attitude towards it, playing with mobile phones, living our life. Why? Because we think that is none of our business. However, in “The Uninhabitable Earth,” David Wallace-Wells shows the possible results after the deterioration of the earth's environment in front of the audience without any cover, which makes us can't help thinking "what should we do?"
               <br><br>


I don’t want to say which subtopic really impresses me because everyone is important. They are closely related to our daily life. The point of this article is to warn the audience that the climate crisis always has an influence on us and nobody can escape that. Maybe some people only care about their own comfort. Something like human reproduction, the environment of the earth has nothing to do with them. In the beginning, I also think that enjoying my own life is enough. But as I grow older, I want to protect the people I love and the people who love me. In order to do that, it is necessary to pay attention to environmental issues and share this article with friends and families.



</p><hr>

<p>
After reading the article, I can say I was alarmed about how urgent this problem is and how exacerbated it can become in the future if nothing occurs soon. With that said, I cannot help but to reference that Wallace-Wells notes the scientist who know the most about the topic are the most optimistic when regarding the subject. Many casual readers may be very alarmed by what Wallace-Wells writes, and rightfully so, but if the people who know this topic the most and spend their lives attempting to stop climate change, I feel he was conveying to us that we should not be so scared. Like the article notes, through the ingenuity of humans we have evaded multiple extinction scenarios. Not to say this problem is not massive, because it is and needs to be addressed, but it is not worth shutting down over. The more productive option would be to do something about it and create a change in the world. 
               <br><br>


Concerning the 'alarmist' attitude,  Wallace-Wells,  I believe played it perfectly. HE presented the evidence and scientifically accepted projections of future of climate change and challenges us to do something about it. The article is not to make us upset about the future, its a call to action, inviting us to go out and do something in the world and fix this catastrophic problem we face.

After reading the article I agree with you that Wallace-wells does an exquisite job on playing the alarmist role and creating this article to have it serve as a call to action. Wallace-Wells paints a detailed picture of a possible future of a grim future that is inevitable if we go about living the way we currently do. From the steady increasing warmth to the effects it will have on society, and the possible resurgence of prehistoric diseases that will wreak havoc on the human race, looking at the big picture makes you think how you do your part in stopping this devastation from occurring.

After reading David Wallace-Wells' article "The Uninhabitable Earth", it is easy to see how his perspective is an alarmist one, however, I don't believe that his pessimistic attitude is necessarily wrong. While some may argue that he may actually "incapacitate us with fear" and lead people to believe that we are doomed no matter what, it is clear that other, less alarmist warnings, haven't been largely effective either. Since many of those other warnings have been either ineffective or not effective enough (as the necessary actions have not yet been taken), I believe that Wells is making a positive step forward by trying something different and taking such an alarmist stance. 
               <br><br>
For me personally, this article opened my eyes to how pressing of an issue climate change is and how many drastic changes I may end up seeing in my own lifetime. I always thought that the effects of climate change would be most apparent hundreds of years from now, but the fact that by 2090 2 billion people may be breathing air that is not "safe" shows that it isn't - it is something our own generation will have to deal with too. Wells' article also opened my eyes to the fact that there are so many other issues that will arise as a result of climate change that hadn't even crossed my mind before, for example, the reintroduction of deadly plagues that we don't have immunity against. It is hard to wrap my head around the fact that we might see a return of the bubonic plague, something I read about in textbooks but never thought would ever be a problem again - after all, it was supposed to be "gone". Furthermore, I always pictured the effects of climate change to be entirely environmental; I never thought that a mere 1/2 degree increase in temperature could increase armed conflict up to 20%.
               <br><br>
In my opinion, David Wallace-Well's alarmist stance is an effective one. It opened my eyes to just how extensive the effects of climate change are, how many problems it will create and how many people it will effect, and I hope that it will help bring the changes we need to turn things around.

I thought that the reading, “The Uninhabitable Earth”, although very terrifying and pessimistic, was successful in creating a morbid picture of our future if we continue to allow climate change to progress. I think that this article is effective in urging its readers to act and not only calls for everyone to join together, but to collectively do our best in creating a more sustainable and healthy planet for the future. The topic that stood out to me the most from this article is the section about climate plagues. I may seem naive, but I never realized how much danger there is in letting so much ice melt globally and that there were so many diseases such as the bubonic plague and various strands of the flu and smallpox trapped inside of ice. As global temperatures increase and ice melts, diseases are released and our immune systems, which are very susceptible to these unknown, more primitive diseases, struggle to fight off disease. Wells tries to comfort his readers by stating that most diseases trapped in ice would not survive thawing, however he later says that those that do would create a powerful virus that could cause massive devastation across the globe. 
               <br><br>


What interests me about this article is Wells’ ability to attract his readers from the beginning of the article and how he focuses on the various consequences that could bring great destruction to the planet. Although some people may say that he takes an alarmist stance on climate change, I think that Wells, despite beginning with a pessimistic tone, ends his article in hopes of leaving his readers with newfound knowledge and self-awareness that they can use to face the growing problem of global warming and solve the climate crisis before it becomes too far out of hand. Wells provides his audience with not only a list of the consequences of our actions, he highlights that these massive, destructive problems are a result of our own carelessness and inaction. He makes his readers think about their own actions and urges them to make a change in their own lifestyle because if we continue with our current, wasteful, and unsustainable lifestyles, there will be dire and deadly diseases.

I agree; it is unfortunate that open discourse about climate change can be difficult to have, but I feel the issue must take priority over our feelings and shyness towards sounding a bit senile. We must encourage people to do something, no matter how minor, to promote steps in the right direction for fighting climate change. However, judging by Wells, little nudges are hardly enough to induce the necessary change. While I have much to learn, it seems ridiculous to shame people for plastic straws and things such as this when the major culprits are the industries that encourage deforestation to obtain palm oil and the various other injustices to our environment. 
               <br><br>


Personally, I find the emphasis on plague and disease a little arrogant on our part as humans since we're the one's who caused this.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I felt quite heart heavy, scared, and kind of upset. The depictions of all the possible ways of how everything will one day come to an end in the near future is terrifying. I mean imagine how it would feel to be “cooked to death from the inside and out” just by being outside, it is absurd that we’ve collectively led that to become a possible outcome. When I got to the section where Wallace-Wells talks about field workers in El Salvador and how the majority of them have chronic kidney disease due to dehydration, it kind of hit close to home, literally. I’m from the central valley, which is a very agricultural dominant region. I know many parents and even some friends who work in the fields, and I see how tough the job already is, and now on top of that with the temperature increasing people in the future could get this disease, which is expensive to get treatment for and the pay rate is not good enough to pay get it. Also, certain areas will become too hot to crop anything therefore losing their “optimal growing temperature… declining productivity”, meaning the field workers will lose their job. It just isn’t fair because they are working to provide for all of us to get our recourses and they get repaid with a disease and no job. 
               <br><br>

Another thing that’s terrifying is that plagues that killed millions of people in the past could come back, like what?!? Before I read this, I did not know diseases where still trapped in the ice, I maybe thought animals from the ice age, but not live viruses. The fact that my grandkids or great grandkids can one day be suffering through that makes me not want to bring them into this world. Moreover, I feel like a lot of people associate climate change with the ocean levels rising, but wat I rarely hear is about “ocean acidification”, mainly because I too was not very aware of this. A majority of the marine life will die or more so fry, decreasing their population and decreasing our food supply. Even the catch that is acquired will be too acidic for our body pH and it could “induce seizures, comas, and sudden death.”  pretty scary if you ask me.

One comment you mentioned that resonated with me was how the issue of the field workers in El Salvador hit close to home for you. My entire family is from El Salvador so I could relate to it hitting home also. I was unaware that one-fifth of the Salvadoran population in the sugar cane region has chronic kidney disease due to dehydration from working the fields in extreme heat. I felt sad because treatment for kidney failure is not cheap and most of El Salvador's population is living in poverty and can barely afford every day necessities. I can only imagine how many men and women are dying from this every day and every year as only a handful are able to afford dialysis. I feel reading this article shed light onto my lack of knowledge on the climate crisis making me even more excited to continue learning and reading about the negative effects our country is causing on developing countries, like El Salvador and start making real changes myself. 
               <br><br>

And I agree. Learning about all that may happen in the future frightens me and makes me question having kids with my future partner. Would bringing a child into this world, knowing all that may come, make me a bad mother? I'm not sure, but what I can say is that it is affecting me and make me question my future life. Changes need to happen now before it is too late and we are the generation that will make it happen. I feel optimistic about our future, but I can't say it doesn't frighten me to think about the what if's.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” was one of the first articles I have read that actually listed all of the consequences of climate change and described in detail how our earth would be impacted. As Wallace-Wells points out in the first section “Doomsday”, one of the reasons why we have not done as much to stop this process as we could have is the incomprehensible scale of the problem – it is difficult to imagine what life will actually be like in a few decades if we do not act now. Most people downplay the magnitude of climate change simply because it is nearly impossible to come to terms with something that has never happened before – at least not with humans alive to witness it.
               <br><br>

This brings me to the next aspect about Wallace-Wells’ article that stuck out to me: I knew the earth has already experienced several mass extinctions; however, I had no idea that most of them were caused by greenhouse gases that resulted in climate change. This knowledge should be evidence enough how colossal this problem is and that it actually can lead to the end of our earth as we know it. Considering this, I believe that Wallace-Wells’ alarmist approach is justified. Scientists have warned us about climate change for years, yet only recently people have started taking this issue seriously. Even now, there is a huge group of people who still do not feel like it is their responsibility to act and change their lifestyle, simply because the reality of the situation scares them too much to admit that it is actually happening. Therefore, we need people like Wallace-Wells who give detailed explanations of what will probably happen in the next few decades in order to help people visualize the impact climate change will have on our lives. 
               <br><br>

On the other hand, I do understand the risk in taking an alarmist approach to the situation. Most people who deny climate change probably feel like everybody is just overreacting and would not even make it past the first paragraph of Wallace-Wells’ article. It is difficult to come up with ways to could persuade those people that climate change is a real threat to our lives and cannot be ignored any longer. If you downplay the severity of the situation, you are not doing anyone a favor by purposely making it look like the problem is not as monumental as it really is. However, if you are honest about the facts and the reality of it all, those who are already having doubts about the accuracy of climate change will probably not be easily convinced. Nonetheless, articles like these are absolutely necessary to inform people about the future changes of our earth. I really liked the last few paragraphs where it was mentioned that climate scientists have a strange kind of faith since they still believe that we will find a way to prevent global warming from happening, simply because we have no other option. Hopefully, this faith will be able to encourage and motivate us all that we have the power to change the seemingly inevitable outcome.

After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” it does seem like one of its primary purposes is to scare the audience and the article in fact did scare me as I read through it. David Wallace-Wells used an alarmist approach to illustrate the magnitude of the consequences humans will have to live through as a result of their actions. I agree in saying that articles like these are necessary solely because it’s a perspective we rarely hear about. Most of the time climate change is talked about like the future that Wallace-Wells describes will certainly not happen should humans take action, but it doesn’t seem like such a hopeful future will actually occur.

               <br><br>

One reason I think this happens is because is seems like most people, if they are like me, don’t really understand the full consequences of climate change. This is why I like the format of the article so much; the author lists some catastrophic events that will happen should we not change our course. This really helped me understand how all the ways the Earth will change and how these changes affect me and well as the billions of humans on this planet.
<br><hr>

Connecting to your mention of the "Doomsday" section of the article, this is the part of the article that stuck out to me the most. I thought I was somewhat well informed on the current climate crisis but I had no idea about the North Pole tragedy until I started reading "The Uninhabitable Earth". 
               <br><br>
What worries me is that we've been brainwashed to think the climate is slowly changing and it won't really affect us for many years...but the destruction is happening now. I don't understand how so many people, including me, continue each day without freaking out about how bad this problem is. Do oil companies and politicians and billionaires really not care about their children and grandchildren's lives? I know humans(most Americans), including me, can be selfish and not care about the affects of climate change on the poorest people on earth or the animals around the world, but "The Uninhabitable Earth" addresses that we are literally killing ourselves. The same way that smoking cigarettes or eating fast food is killing us, but we look past it because it's all we know or we know and don't care because we're making money off of it. 
               <br><br>
Like you said in your second paragraph, most of the mass extinctions so far, have been caused by too much greenhouse gas emissions and inevitably climate change. This is new knowledge to me as well and I can't believe we couldn't have learned from past evidence like we do with history of science or war. We are now to blame for the crisis that our kids are going to have to deal with and possibly fail.
               <br><br>
I agree with you that we should not downplay the climate crisis. It may sound radical that 'we should be more alarmed' like Wallace-Wells said in the article, but think about how alarmed we are about terrorism or immigration. Why can't we look at the big picture and be alarmed about the climate, because without an inhabitable planet there are no possible problems like world hunger or world peace that we can work to solve.

<p>
David Wallace-Wells "alarmist" approach to climate change is much needed for change to happen. Prior to reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" I was uneducated on just how bad our world has been destroyed as it didn't directly affect my daily life. Specifically, paragraph eight where Wallace comments most of the scientists he's spoken to assume we'll lose Miami and Bangladesh within the century even if we stopped burning fossil fuels left me feeling shocked and hopeless. Many of the plausible events he spoke on never crossed my mind or seemed movie like.The fact is our chances are running slim on what we can do to stop further damage to our planet. David Wallace-Well's approach is necessary as it opens the eyes of our population who need to understand that its about when these scenarios will happen to us and not if. 
               <br><br>
Although some of his points such as "A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today" in " Perpetual War" seem exaggerated, it is possible considering our global temperature has rapidly increased. Majority of the world, including myself, are completely unaware of the road we are heading down when it comes to this issue. David Wallace-Wells breaks it down in a way to evoke the call to action mindset that is required for this. This fear causes us to rethink our actions and want to take charge of the future we have left. In my opinion his points are well thought out as they mix predictions with current or past events that have already occurred.

After reading the article “ The Uninhabitable Earth”, I feel sorry about what we humans have done for nature. Before that, I knew we were experiencing global warming, but I did not know how dangerous it could be. Wallace-wells tells us that increasing global temperatures not only brings us hot days and rising sea-level but also deadly climate changes: most of prosperous regions will turn into deserts if that trend goes on. This article is an alarm for everyone, and Wallace-wells tries to wake up more people through this article. One thing really touches me is that many cities in developing countries are suffering from unbreathable air. Wallace illustrates many cities in China. In 2010-2013, heavy industrial cities like Beijing, Tianjing and several cities in southern China had Air Quality Index over 300. Smog also caused a lot of problems in other countries like India and Vietnam. Governments from all countries should cooperate and try to reduce climate crisis through practical actions.
               <br><br>

Wallace-wells also points out that pollution and global warming cause great harm towards ocean. Industrial waste from coasts make nearby ocean become dead zone. Ocean becomes more acidic since great amount of CO2 caused by global warming start to dissolve into water. Due to increasing acidity, many reefs die and marine life who needs reefs also begin to die. These severe problems upset oceanic ecosystems quite badly.

This article wakes me up ,and I realize that our world is not peaceful as it looks. Let’s do something for making the world beautiful again!

I agree and I had the same impression of the article. Its important to be aware of these current events . Its overwhelming to see all these catastrophes compiled into one era. However, I really loved the way you brought it around and ended with a positive view because thats what we need to do as the future of the world. Make the world beautiful again! I will say that with articles like these that focus on the bad, they tend to ignore the good that we are doing for the world, multiple nations have been cleaning up their act including us. Even though our climate crisis is extremely bad, I do believe we are taking steps in a positive direction for example, Jakarta just banned single use plastics. (A place that has been drowning in plastic is finally taking a stand.) We can hope this kind of influence has an effect on other places in Indonesia and other places around those parts!

The uninhabitable earth by Wallace Wells was eye-opening and honestly scary. Starting with heat, temperatures rising at an alarming rate not only going to cause permafrost melting in the artic releasing almost more than 2 times the carbon and methane in the atmosphere than whats currently submerged in the earth. I was already so shocked to learn in lecture that there was all this carbon within the earth and the harm that it could cause when released, so reading that there is more than twice that much in the artic and how the artic is already starting to melt was mind-blowing.  Another interesting thing that came up was climate change and its influence and war. The article says mention how because of this the US military is “obsessed” with climate change. It makes sense why they would be concerned with the military but if this part of the government can realize and make changes for climate change why is there not more support from the government to make changes to help slow down this process. You’d think some kind of laws or something would be passed to help.  
               <br><br>
Wallace Wells lays out the consequences if we don’t do anything regarding climate change. I personally do find him as an alarmist because after putting down this article immediately felt the fear of the repercussions and knew things needed to change. While some people might not be a fan of the alarmist approach it seems to be one of the best ways to get results, hit people with the facts of what could come.

Although Wells’ does approach his argument with the “alarmist” approach, I believe it doesn’t deserve to be attached to the negative connotation conservatives and skeptics of climate change associate with it. Yes, as I read the article, it woke me up and made me realize that we’re basically doomed because this isn’t an exaggeration. What’s worse, there are scientific facts to support his claims, yet, people still refuse to listen. The consequences of Anthropogenic climate change is leading future generations into living on an inhabitable earth causing the demise of our species as we know it. Wells’ isn’t trying to sugar coat the reality of climate change. He outlines the possibilities and evident future that will become a reality if anthropogenic climate change continues to raise global temperatures by 2-4 degrees. 
               <br><br>

What I took away from the reading the most was the melting of the ice in section IV “Climate Plagues”. The fact that the arctic ice preserves even the most deadly diseases from the past is truly breathtaking. More so, species of bugs that existed in the past that can be extremely deadly and monstrous to our species. This alone made me think that flooding and rising temperatures  aren’t the only problems that come with anthropogenic climate change. Climate change will affect all aspects of human life in one way or another. As a species and as a society, we need to normalize the thought of a global catastrophe no matter how hard it may be to break old habits. Adjusting to saving our planet isn’t the same as giving up soda or a toxic significant other. These “little habits” will lead to our demise if we don’t start to think about what Wells’ describes as an “unimaginable alternative” and associate CO2 emissions reaching 440 ppm being as bad as state emergencies like 9/11.

I greatly agree with your stance that even though Wallace-Wells certainly had an alarmist approach, which he even admits to in his book and follow up articles, it does not necessarily mean that it is a negative aspect. The doom and gloom of the article definitely put me off at first, but it allowed him to better express his points and include crucial details rather than dancing around the brunt of the situation the world stands in. Without people like Wallace-Wells stating the truth in an explicit matter, the world will continue to ignore reality and live as if nothing is inherently wrong with the normalized consumerism lifestyle of today. His future may not fully come to fruition, but the compilation of the worst possibilities given the current circumstances allow for us to be woken up and take measures to prevent the worst of it.
               <br><br>


In that same tune, I also concur the adjustment of normal thought regarding the climate. The section on Climate Plagues also deeply affected me as it was one of the consequences that I had no idea about. Consequences like sea level rise and air quality are more commonly known for they have been a prominent part of environmental advertising. However, the depth of these consequences are often disregarded as focus is placed on certain details. Often times, I forget how rich in history the Earth has been and with that history, it brings up tons of unknown factors, such as the diseases of the past, that we truly have no or little details surrounding them. The human species is just a blip in the history of the Earth. If the sixth extinction comes fully into fruition, then the Earth still may be able to recover as it has from extinctions past. However, that certainly would be without much of the same life of today and possibly without human beings at all.

-       Before reading The Uninhabitable Earth, I thought I knew fairly a lot about the effects of climate change; the ice caps are melting, it’s getting hotter, and the ozone layer is being destroyed. But what I didn’t know is that those although those things are obviously important, there are much more dire effects that are going to take place because of the earth being heated at an extremely alarming rate. One of the most shocking things that Wallace talks about in the article to me is the prediction about the “Poisoned Oceans.” Most people have heard about how the sea levels are rising because of the melting ice caps and so forth but I feel as if most people do not know that the Oceans are to become extremely acidic and inhabitable creating extreme ‘dead zones’ and killing all aquatic life while replacing it with oxygen consuming, cancer-like bacteria. So on top of the oceans getting larger and engulfing our coastal cities, it will be extremely acidic and dangerous. 
               <br><br>
-        Another extremely intriguing piece of this article is the indirect effects that will begin to happen because of the climate rising including perpetual war and economic collapse. It is somewhat apparent that indeed when it gets too hot, water will run out, which will then deplete food resources, which will then cause famine. But the indirect effects of this issue are also very alarming. When people begin to get thirst more often and begin to starve, they will get angry and start lashing out at authorities and each other. Once this begins to happen, I’m sure there will be no hope to ban people together in order to stop the earth from heating even more.

The article by David Wallace-Wells, while very depressing and scary, is the real truth about climate change that must be said. Wallace-Wells uses a very upfront and honest style of writing to describe the climate crisis which causes some people to take action while others become fearful and standstill. The article doesn’t provide us with anything to look forward to and nothing to hope for which is what most people need to get active and motivated to try and do something. However, it is also important that the public knows the bare truth and that is what Wallace-Wells is giving them. 
                <br><br>
As mentioned in the article, most climate scientists are very conservative about the numbers and projections to not scare people, but that in itself is scary. The fact that scientists feel the need to hold back true information because they don’t want people to get scared is what is really scary. In Wallace-Wells’ article however, he bares the whole truth. This is important because people need to understand how bad the situation is and how even if we were to stop burning fossil fuels, eating animal products and using non-renewables, we will still see, and are already seeing, very awful consequences.
                <br><br>
I thought it was interesting that Wallace-Wells brought up a whole variety of issues that could arise from the effects of climate change, most of them things I had never thought of before. For example, the idea that there are diseases trapped in the Arctic ice that haven’t circulated the air in millions of years is crazy to think about because when that ice melts because of climate change, we will be exposed to those diseases that our bodies can’t easily fight off. Things like this are real potential effects of climate change, but they aren’t explained and communicated enough. David Wallace-Wells, by including this potential and many more, is showing people what really could happen, and likely will happen in the Earth’s near future.



</p><hr>

<p>
Wallace’s article presents an astounding array of causes and effects of anthropogenic climate change. Factors that I previously wouldn’t have considered to be connected to the climate crisis, such as ancient plagues and war, are revealed to be very much involved. What shocks me the most, however, is how powerhouse countries seem to take little regard in the IPCC’s sturdy findings. Their thorough facts provide a convincing argument as to why countries should care about climate change and how they can reduce their own emission levels. One reason that may have led bigger countries such as the United States to dismiss the peril of climate change is the alarmist approach many scientists, including David Wallace, use. Although their tactics are meant to scare the public into cooperation, their evidence is far from exaggerated. I admire Wallace’s thorough research and how he uses a variety of sources to create a collage of the perception of climate change. In his presentation, I found the unbreathable air to be the most compelling section. This crisis has been seen already in large cities such as Beijing and even in films such as The Lorax, a prophecy largely supported by Wallace’s research. All in all, I believe this article illustrates the issues of the climate crisis very well.



</p><hr>

<p>
I would consider Wallace’s stance to be alarmist, but I do not take an issue with this stance as because the growing problems that are created by climate change should alarm all us. As I made my way through Wallace’s article I found myself becoming more and more saddened with the facts and numbers I was seeing, because I know this scenario is not a fantasy dystopia. This is a real possibility if things do not change, especially considering there is essentially a ticking time bomb of CO2 that could be released into the atmosphere from millions of acres of permafrost.The problems we face go far beyond rising sea levels and rising temperatures. They are not something that can simply be put off or ran away from. Even though some of these problems may not affect an area right now does not mean that it will not spread to that area.
                <br><br>


I was given a semblance of hope towards the end of the article when Wallace gives a historical perspective on the issue, citing that the large majority of carbon emissions have only occurred in the past three decades or so. While this fact is not the least bit encouraging by itself, I found comfort in knowing that the generation born within this time is now getting to the age where they can make a change and combat this issue themselves. Young adults, like myself, who have grown up during this age and have seen how those before us have let the world deteriorate are now getting to age where we have a voice in our government and can take action in response to these issues that will continue to affect as in our lives.

After reading David Wallace wells' article "the Unihabitable earth", I'm not as optimistic about our living environment as before. I used to think that human activities had an impact on the environment, and our living environment has become more difficult, but these impacts are limited and they will not affect our generation, but the fact is contrary to my cognition. Although Wallace used many aggressive and frightening words in his article, I can feel that he really wanted people to be able to Recognize the terrorist consequences of human actions.
                <br><br>


In fact, there are many examples that have confirmed Wallace's statement that it is not alarmist that our human activities are destroying the atmosphere on which we live, and the earth is getting warmer and warmer, which is not a good thing, but we have not made real efforts to improve our environment, even if many of us have the resources to do so. But because of the neglect of environmental problems, not many people will take action. There is a very limited amount that one can do, but I believe that if everyone makes a contribution to environmental protection, the impact will be huge.

<p>
When I first opened the article and finished reading the first segment I felt overwhelmed. As I continued reading I felt like I was living under a rock after realizing the many ways the Earth is dying. While the article was difficult to get through because of fear it creates I thought it was important to read. I was surprised by learning that past diseases are making a comeback and diseases we are not even prepared for are also capable of occurring. I think that fact is what made me most fearful and what I will stay thinking about for weeks. 
                <br><br>

I do not know a lot about climate change or science so the article was a lot of information to take in at once. I think the more educated we are about the problems around us the more likely we will create change.

Hey, I would agree with you that the article, "The Unattainable Earth" is overwhelming due to the number of issues that arise from climate change. I actually appreciated Wallis Well's alarmist approach to the issue because climate change is not something that should be taken lightly, rather it is something we should all try to be more informed about. I think it is important to install a little fear in the reader in order to provoke action that can lead to a positive change, after all, we are the reason the planet is in chaos environmentally. 
<br><br>
Climate Plagues along with food scarcity is what really caught my attention in Well's article. I was also shocked by knowing that past diseases have the capacity to recur once the Arctic ice melts. I was unaware of the fact that Arctic ice has the ability to trap diseases from millions of years ago. This is scary to think about because our immune systems would not be able to fight back against these diseases and unfortunately many of us would die as a result. 
<br><br>
Following the concern of death, that can very well also occur due to food scarcity. Climate change causes many 'natural' disasters which are not so natural after all. Droughts are a concern because the soil in many places around the world such as the Middle East, South America, and South Africa to name some regions will no longer have reliable food sources. Rivers and streams will dry up resulting in famine and starvation for many.

David Wallace-Wells did a good job to propagandize the endangered future of the Earth. Based on his past article and events, I know he is the person who dedicates his life in researching climate changing and propagandize his idea. It is a really hard job. People do not care about the long term crisis because the crisis will not affect their life immediately, or people are too busy to care about the long term crisis. However, the owers of environmentally hazardous businesses will attack a person like David Wallace-Wells in all aspects because David's idea really hurt their benefit. As the sermonizer, David is hard to get any actual benefit except some good fame, and he needs to keep his behavior rigorous to avoid the fame-attacking from the opponent. I really respect him. 

                <br><br>

I agree with half of his opinions on the Uninhabitable Earth, like 2. Heat Death, 4. Climate Plagues, 5. Unbreathable Air, 8. Poisoned Oceans. The first and last chapter is more like a conclusion and introduction. I believe there is a paradox in his idea. He believed people sacrifice the environment to develop the world which is true. But history proves that capitalism and the industrial revolution are the most efficient way to improve every human's life quality. A lot of his opinion is about to build an ideal world without industrial and capitalism which will hurt everybody's benefit, and decrease their life quality permanent, some poor people even will die. This is not practical. For most people survive is important than everything. Some of his ideas, like 6. perpetual war and 7. permanent economic collapse are not supported by solid evidence. 

                <br><br>

Generally, it is good to have people warn people about the environmental issue frequently. People also should think about how to reduce less pollution with the same amount of production. I believe the technology improving and better education is the best way.

In the wake of the fires wreaking havoc on Australia, David Wallace-Wells article “the Uninhabitable Earth” seems to be a blunt and realistic piece of writing simply informing us of a future where society has almost collapsed from climate change. According to Wallace, the world would spin out of control with permanent economic collapse and unbreathable air being just some of the issues we will be confronted with from humans’ irresponsible and careless actions. In a factual tone, he presents us with countless facts that drill into the audiences heads just how bleak of a future our future generations have. Every claim he makes is backed up by numerous facts that leave almost no place for debate about the subject like, “at the end of the century, if the planet is 5 degrees warmer, we’ll have 50% more people to feed and 50% less food to provide”. These worrying numbers show the depth of the consequences the future of humanity will have to go through because of our lack of awareness, or even care for this planet.
                 <br><br>
Wallace- Wells is not an alarmist. Although he does write in a dramatic nature and does present worst case scenarios, he does not exaggerate the situation or cause needless panic. All the facts presented are true and have been researched extensively by scientists meaning he presents the situation as it is. I believe so many people are labelling him as an alarmist because they themselves are scared of the future, or refuse to accept it, therefore calling him an alarmist to comfort themselves. People need to accept this future as truth, and then will they be motivated to attempt to create change.

As a fourth year Environmental Studies major, I am no stranger to this Wallace-Wells article. Being the fourth or fifth time I have read this, my thought process has shifted from that of extreme concern and dismay to the side of this article's effectiveness as a tool for change. Wells does indeed do a great job of summarizing major areas of climate science as well as presenting the possible scenarios that we may face in the future. Although, I ask myself if his "doomsday" rhetoric approach is the most compelling way to inspire change. The truth is, there is a dire need for immediate action from all of earth's citizens, but I feel that the approach wells uses may alienate and dishearten many people. I think it is easy for many of us, as educated young students, to look at the scenarios presented and understand how pressing and important these issues since we are the ones that will ultimately deal with them. There are others however, that find it much easier to carry on business as usual either from lack of knowledge or from active/passive denial. From the perspective of someone on the edge of climate denial, I'd imagine that an argument based on motivation and opportunity would be more compelling than the so called "alarmist" approach. Even though I personally think this approach is important, I am not the type of person that needs this information. Articles meant to inspire change should be directed toward the people that need to change the most. The people that need this information the most are those on the cusp of denial and inaction. It seems that rather than alienating people and reminding them that they are in fact, the root of the problem, it would be more useful to inspire people to be part of the solution. Even though it can be useful to push these unfortunately likely climate scenarios, I think they must be supplemented with narratives of change in areas that are less controversial. I think narratives of "green" economic opportunities and sustainability complement climate science, because they frame the arguments for reducing our carbon footprint directly in terms of our own bottom line. The average person may not be well-versed enough to understand the intricacies and complex systems that make up climate science, but they can understand that there own pocket and lifestyle will benefit from a low carbon lifestyle. Personally, I think pushing on narratives like economic growth in the renewable energy sector, are more effective than pushing people towards a plant- based diet. That is not to say that renewable energy is more important, because we know that changing diets is arguable a much better approach for immediately reducing our carbon footprint. That is just an area that is not so deeply rooted into a person's cultural and social identity. The hope would be, that by being introduced to these "easier-to-swallow" narratives, people would be inspired to make the more drastic and necessary lifestyle changes.

<p>
Rather than referring to Wells as an alarmist, I would suggest readers to take into consideration all of the factual details that he includes in his article. If he were an alarmist, Wells would blow things out of proportion and exaggerate the points that he made. But, Wells articulated his points with clarity and supports his arguments with evidential data. Instead of classifying him as an alarmist, I would label him as a realist because he is, in fact, not exaggerating the dangers of climate change but simply pointing them out to whomever stumbles upon his article. None of his claims were dramaticized or amplified, but simply stated. I do agree that fear is instilled within readers, but the fear is rooted in the dangers that climate change presents, not Wells’ statements. The truth that climate change presents is horrifying in itself, and Wells just happens to be presenting it. I don’t believe that Wells alienates his readers in this article, but rather informs them of what is yet to come to our planet Earth. It empowers readers to open their eyes to what is happening right in front of them.
                 <br><br>


Subsequent reading the article, I feel prompted to take action against climate change. I do feel like I am an “eco-conscious” citizen by recycling and minimizing waste among other things, but Wells inspires me to take a step further and think about my food consumption. I am not a vegan, vegetarian, or pescatarian. I love meat, whether it’s hamburgers, steak, tacos, or anything in between. But what’s more important than my love for meat is the dire need for humans to cut back on meat consumption because of the harmful contribution to greenhouse gases. 
                 <br><br>


The most compelling part of the article was Section VII, where Wells conveyed that “before fossil fuels, nobody lived better than their parents or grandparents…” This statement stood out to me because our generation’s technology and advancements make our lives completely different than our parents’. My mother always reminds me of what her life was like growing up in Southeast Asia, and how lucky I am to be growing up in the age of new technology. Yet, nobody realizes the environmental impact of these advancements and use of fossil fuels. This gave me a new perspective on our age’s technology--yes, the quality of life has dramatically increased, but the damage we are doing to our planet has quite the opposite effect.



</p><hr>

<p>
I never realized the intensity of climate change until reading this article. Climate change is not something that has just begun to cause a problem after millions of years but something that has slowly been developing. There’s more to it than just the things you’ve heard about when handed a flyer. Permafrost could cause serious damage to our environment if there are no efforts to change our way of living. If the permafrost is to become the opposite of its name, Earth would change completely.
                  <br><br>
It surprises me that even though these changes could be drastic, people still choose to ignore the signs. No one wants to learn about the effects climate change has on the Earth and they certainly don’t want to change any of their habits, even if it means helping keep their home. I don’t think the purpose of this article was to convince people to change how they do things but to instead inform everybody that we’re already doomed. There’s no changing the damage we have done, all we can do is slow it down. Maybe not even that. We’ll most likely be extinct, just like many of the other animals that were extinct due to climate change. The article stresses how we will most likely die due to being boiled from the heat, which we could help with air conditioning but at the same time be adding to the carbon problem.
                  <br><br>
It’s interesting how the article states all the ways we could become extinct even if it’s not from heat-stroke. The article really wants to make you think of all the other events that occur because of climate change. Starvation, drought, plague, bad air quality and maybe even war are other devastations brought by climate change. As the article said, we could get smallpox if the Arctic ice were to melt. All the diseases and bugs and other things that were trapped in there when it was frozen, would just be released. This is shocking to me that people would rather release plagues than change habits, and now we can only delay the inevitable. think it’s unacceptable the amount of people refusing to make a change and because of this, we won’t have the Earth for much longer.

I think David Wallace-Wells does a good job of putting a face behind the numbers surrounding climate change we see every day. He states himself that the "smallness... largeness... and abstractness"(I) of these numbers makes it difficult for the average reader to understand what these numbers really signify. The problem of climate change becomes incomprehensible. He mentions that 12 degrees of warming would kill half the population of earth simply through heat (II). This is a mindnumbing and depressing statistic. It really opened my eyes to the danger climate change possesses to our lives. He also mentions that the heat index in Middle East and Persian Gulf has already reached "163 degrees Fahrenheit"(II). I simply did not believe this and had to look it up myself. My google search led me to discover it was not only true, but people in the past believed it was physically impossible for the heat index to go above 160 degrees Fahrenheit. David Wallace-Wells not only gives evidence of what could happen, but evidence of what has already happened due to climate change. I believe his intent was to create a sense of urgency, but it was more effective in creating a sense of hopelessness. 

                  <br><br>

David Wallace-Wells states early in the article that "sober-minded scientists" whom he has interviewed generally came to this conclusion: "No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent disaster" (I). He makes the problem of climate change seem like an inevitable, apocalyptic, and disastrous event. He focuses very little on what we can do to prevent it, and spends way too much time explaining what will happen if we do not. He says we have to fight climate change while saying there is no way we can win. He makes an attempt to inspire hope at the end of the article, sating that "scientists have an enormous confidence in the ingenuity of humans"(IX), but this is not enough. In attempt to scare us into action, he has scared many into hopeless submission.



</p><hr>

<p>
I have read many climate change articles in the past, but none that were as frightening yet also eye opening as Wallace-Well’s The Habitable Earth. While some may deem Wallace an alarmist, with our current global climate and the limited action that is being taken to reduce these effects I think Wallace is taking the necessary precautions by painting a clear picture of what our future would look like if we continue emissions as we are. Therefore there should be less of a negative connotation around “alarmists”, because we should be alarmed at the projected future of our planet. While he states this is just a possibility of what could happen, he also justifies all of his arguments using numerical predictions that have been collected from climatologists and interviewing all types of scientists on these matters. One of the most alarming statistics to me that he predicted is related to Heat Death. With a warming of 11 degrees, half of the population would die of heat, which seems almost incomprehensible. While we are not near 11 degrees of warming, if we keep accelerating our greenhouse gas emissions this could occur in the near future. 
                  <br><br>

Another thing that really tied all of the information together was hearing Sarah Rose Grossman and Linda O’connor’s numbers on what is currently going on. Wallace presented a lot of knowledge on past eras, previous extinctions, and his future projections. But hearing things like we emitted 40.5 billion tons of CO2 just in 2019, have had a 13% drop in sea ice, and the past 5 years have been the hottest recorded demonstrates the direction we are heading in because these issues are getting significantly worse in our present lifetimes. One of Wallace’s arguments was that the reason our society is unable to fully comprehend the extent of the path we are going down is because we simply cannot picture it happening and affecting us personally. Therefore I think his call for immediate action by warning us of what the future might hold is a good thing.

I found this article, “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace, extremely interesting and eye opening to the crisis of climate change. To be entirely honest, I am not very educated on the topic so I believe that this is a great introduction to the course and to this movement. The staggering statistics and specific facts were very interesting and convincing.

Some points made by Wallace in his piece that really resonated with me were when he says, that with less ice in the Arctic from global warming melting it, less heat from the sun is reflecting off of our planet and the earth is just absorbing it. I believe this was an extremely great fact to include because it is sort of layman’s terms that most people can conceptualize regardless of their level of education, understanding of science, or the effects of climate change. Another shocking fact mentioned in the article is that the permafrost, ice that is buried very deep in the ice caps that is never supposed to melt, holds 1.8 trillion tons of carbon. Just that amount alone, of  any substance, should provoke extreme fear and motivate an individual to want change. That much carbon being released into our atmosphere along with all the other organisms and diseases trapped in that ice would be extremely detrimental to the planet and its population.
                  <br><br>

Overall, I found this article very informative with a strong call to action to all individuals around the world that the time is now before it's too late. We must save our planet from extreme heat or we will all die with it.

I appreciated Wallace's use of layman's terms to describe these environmental dangers because it makes this information so much more accessible to regular people. A lot of journals and articles are overloaded with scientific terminology that just obfuscates the meaning for people who don't know those terms. This lessens the sense of urgency that people should feel about climate change since they don't really understand it. I didn't really understand in depth the specific dangers that come with climate change until I read Wallace's article, and I'm sure many people feel the same. What was most shocking to me was when Wallace mentioned that melting ice caps can release diseases that could cause something like the second Black Plague. Almost all students learn about the Black Plague starting elementary or middle school and how devastating it was to the human population, so that comparison was especially easy to understand which made the dangers of climate change even more alarming. Although the article is a bit alarmist, I feel that that aspect is necessary so that we can pressure people in power to take drastic and effective action.

When I read The Unhabitable Earth, I was very shocked and blown away. It made me realized how bad a situation we are in on this earth. When I read through all the different scenarios that can happen,  it just scared the crud out of me. Especially the part about Unbreathable air. It explains how the Amazon forest holds 20 percent of our oxygen in the world and would be bad if a forest fire spread around this area since it had a "hundred-year drought".(David Wallace-Wells) In the news lately, there was a huge fire in the Amazon. This could likely lower our oxygen levels and make this scenario a reality.  With some events happening now, this article could have readers become incapacitated with fear. This is a gloomy, sad, and alarming article. It mostly shows apocalyptic scenarios that end up destroying humanity that could actually happen. With readers being in fear, this could increase in action. I believe it is not a bad thing to put people in fear. This opens up a new picture of what could happen if we do nothing for this earth. People have to know. at some point that something needs to change to survive. If we don't care for this planet, then it won't be able to care for us.

From the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, he described a very clear picture of the future climate change and reflected hundreds of consequences what would happen if we keep polluting the environment. Because of his grim prediction, the outside considered him as an alarmist. I can understand why people would have this thought. People always afraid of the unknown situation and that’s human nature. Especially it is something bad about the future. The researchers refused to accept the truth David Wallace-Wells pointed out even they realized the environment becomes worse and worse on Earth. This is the biggest problem we have faced about human survival business. 

                  <br><br>

As I think, I strongly agree with David Wallace-Wells’s argument. Until now, we still don’t have a perfect idea to solve global warming. And global warming is causing more and more disasters every year. In the face of these natural disasters, human beings are very fragile and small. We have nothing to do with it. Follow this trend, David Wallace-Wells’s prediction will come true one day and humans will be the culprits. However, if we can aware of our behavior is harming the earth, it’s never too late to do something and improve the environment. We shouldn’t fear the future and do nothing after reading David Wallace-Wells’s article. Instead, we should put more effort to protect the environment.

In the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth," David Wallace-Wells points out the worst situation which we will experience in the near future. After reading the article, I find it interesting that Wallace-Wells has linked global warming to the fact that humans have not found any life form in the universe. He explained that this is due to the limited life span of civilization. Referring to the article, civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another (Wallace-Wells, 2017). Recently, the wildfire in Australia is a warning to the world. If we do not act to lower the carbon emissions and failed to meet the Paris goal, humans will certainly end up in extinction.       
                   <br><br>

     Nonetheless, Wallace-Wells is optimistic about the crisis of global warming. Humans are the most intelligent species. We have overcome many obstacles to come to this point. We are optimistic that scientists will find a way to tackle this issue in the near future. While they are working on this issue, let us all try to reduce the carbon level in the environment and ensure humans to have enough time to save this planet!

In the “The Uninhabitable Earth” the author brings up many horrible punishments if we do not stop increasing global temperatures. There are many horrible side effects that are commonly known. But David Wallace-Wells brings up many consequences I had never even thought of. One fact that is pretty obvious to mankind is that sea level rises, but people fail to realize that one third of the world’s major cities are on the coast. These cities contain at least 600 million people. Meaning a huge mass of people will be displaced. Another consequence that comes with warming brought up is that for every half a degree of warming results in 10 to 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict. Finally another factor he points out is that for every degree celsius of warming, it costs a 1.2 percent of GDP. These three factors are different things that Wells points out that many people don’t think of with rising temperatures.
                   <br><br>

 Wells aggressive tactic of scaring us into action is often argued as a good thing by some while others argue another tactic. Many people believe that using an alarming tactic will discourage society and lead to no action. While many think the best way to instill action society is through hope. That a positive outlook at a future of survival is the best way for people to make changes in their life. But I think one of the best ways is through competition, many countries, including americans want to be the best. So if household energy were to be posted, no one would want to be the highest. Therefore competition would not discourage people but motivate society to make changes. This is all based on the fact that this article is quite discouraging and competition would make me want to take action.

I agree with you in the sense that David brings up many horrific, but interesting topics regarding the consequences of the rapid warming that is occurring right in front of us. He lets us know that even if we stop the pumping of CO2 into the atmosphere today, we will still surpass the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping below a 1.5 degree Celcius change in temperature. I was glad he gave us some hope and told us that it is possible to reverse the effects of anthropogenic warming. He hopes the devastation from extreme weather events caused by global warming will be enough to make the entirety of the world population aware that we are in the midst of a climate crisis, and that this issue must be addressed as soon as possible. In particular, the U.S. must step up and join the Paris Agreement once more. I think that David Wallace-Well's aggressiveness in the article is necessary because he lets his readers know the truth, while still giving them hope and reason to keep pushing for change. I also think that this article was directed to those who do not believe global warming is an extreme issue, and that is the reason he is so critical. I appreciate the point you made regarding the competitive aspect when it comes to resolving the problems created by warming. With a carbon tax, companies are still challenged to produce in the most efficient way as possible, and this may force them to look towards more environmentally friendly means of production. New technology creates new economic stimulants, and therefore more for people to invest in. Just because we change our fuel sources to wind, solar, etc. doesn't mean less money. In fact, it creates more opportunities to make money, so this should not be too much of a problem for nations across the world. Overall, David Wallace-Well's lets us know that things will change, and humans will adapt to save our Earth regardless of what it takes.

“The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells may seem to be an alarmist’s view of the climate crisis that we are facing in this day and age, however, it must be taken more seriously than that. This article is not some far-fetched attempt at scaring an audience for the mere sake of attention, it is a deservingly alarming attempt to scare an audience for the sake of attention. Yes, Wells provides information to incite a tone of alarm, but he does this because we need to be alarmed. We need to be scared of what is to come if further action is not taken to stop climate change. Wells introduces consequences of climate change that many readers are likely not aware of. These consequences are most likely inevitable if no measures are taken to change the course of climate change. The media often focuses on issues such as sea-level rise, which is a consequence of climate change, however, this is only one of the many consequences that will arise. Sea-level rise may seem to many to be an issue, but one that is avoidable: just move away from the coastlines. Wells provides many other issues that cannot so easily be tolerated. This is alarming, yes, but we need an alarm. If no one like Wells warns us of the very real issues that we may face, no one will feel the urgency to act. Fear, paired with some level of hope, is a crucial motivator in the fight against climate change. The incitement of fear is not negative in this way because it pushes us towards awareness and action. The sense of alarm that Wells provides concerning issues such as diseases released from arctic ice, CO2 in the ocean, and war as a result of climate change works to bring awareness and inspire action.

Aileen, I completely agree with you. In the very first part of the article, Wallace-Wells brings up the fact that he believes that scientists are not alarming the public as much as he believes they should.  Scientific reticence, he calls it, is very dangerous in my opinion.  Like you stated, this article accurately portrays the risks we are facing by denying or simply ignoring climate change, while not filtering his thoughts.  I also loved your statement that media only concentrates on one portion of the climate crisis.  While sea level change is an important factor that will effect many people, there are other consequences that will soon arise.  I think the reasoning for this capitalization on sea level change is being it is a tangible piece of evidence that many individuals can conceptualize or even see in their own communities, unlike ocean acidification which will not be likely to effect as many people in such a short time frame.  My favorite part about this article is that it was written for the normal person.  Wallace-Wells uses language that many can understand, unlike other scientific journals.  While he does use a lot of facts and numbers in the article, he also strives to make a personal connection with the reader.

In Wallace-Wells’s article, the author mentions a lot of different terrible possible results of the climate change nowadays, if we do not take any action regarding it. From his article, it is easy to see that the problem of climate change is really serious now. It is not just a simple problem of environment any more; instead, it is a problem regarding our live and even the existence of all lives on the Earth today. After listing each point he  also propose some really convincing evidence of research or statistics to persuade his audience that, if we do nothing the Earth will probably be a uninhabitable place for lives. 
                        <br><br>
    I, personally, do not think that Wallace-Wells is a alarmist. In my mind, a alarmist is a person, who is always too pessimistic and always exaggerate some kind of unnecessary alarms to terrify others. However, in Wallace-Wells’s article, the issue he discusses is terrifying but not unnecessary. It is the possible future of the earth, if the situations continue to be worse, and the issue is related to the existence of human beings. Even though the issue he discuss can be a little bit too terrifying, it is still reasonable, because the author want to use this to force people to take actions. Moreover, all the things he discuss is definitely true , and can probably happen.
                      <br><br>
      After reading the article, I think that the article successfully changed my mind that protecting the environment is not a thing faraway from us but a thing that need to be done immediately. It also inform me that my knowledge about environmental protection is definitely not enough, so that I really need to learn more about it.

<p>
Before I read this report, I considered climate changed as an issue that only related to environment without realizing its connection with other aspects of problems. In fact, the consequence of climate change is so severe that many problems emerge all over the world, such as the rise of temperature, starvation, climate plaques, unbreathable air, wars, economic collapse, and poisoned oceans. All of these problems are closely tied to climate change, which is not regarded as a big problem by people. What astonishes me most is that global warming contributes to social conflicts as well. According to the author, “a planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today.” I never thought that the conflicts happened in the Middle East accelerated global warming.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, the audience have been informed a great deal of issues that are the key contributors to the climate crisis. Wallace-Wells applies a very aggressive way to emphasize the severity of the global warming by saying that if humans couldn’t change the way of living in time we will continue to face more horrific dangers. Although some people think Wallace-Wells exaggerated the issue too much and call him “an alarmist”, in my opinion, being the one to stand up and serve a massive wake-up call for public in order to help prevent further damage to our ecosystem needs respect. Such a passionate proposal will definitely encourage more people to introspect and reconsider their daily habits no matter how impactful that may be.
                      <br><br>

After putting down this article, I had the same feelings (overwhelmed and powerless), which I felt when I watched the movies assigned in English 22 also relate to climate change. It seems like a complete change or a realizable solution still requires a long way to go, and making everyone aware of the issue and take actions still faces strong obstructions. Nevertheless, seeing more and more people are willing to make an appeal about climate crisis in all different kinds of ways and realizing more and more people are approaching and paying attention to this big, hot, and significant topic nowadays still brings me some hope.

I agree with your stance on Wallace-Wells being an alarmist and how it is beneficial that he is. I think that the media is quick to take situations like this and contort them in a way that helps them financially, not in ways that look out for the planet. The biggest issue in fixing our planet is convincing those in power that it is more important than the potential economic setbacks.  The article brings up a decrease in a country's GDP if they try to fight climate change but I think that although it may be expensive, in the long run, will be financially viable because we will be able to last longer on this Earth with more renewable resources and less natural catastrophes.

Though Wallace-Wells’ opinion is meant to cause action in changing human behavior, the alarmist view did not motivate me to take part in that action. Though he mentions several great points about the harsh reality of climate change, the extreme pessimism drove me to think that our actions going forward will have little effect on what happens to the planet, so why bother reversing the inevitable? That frame of thought, as a scientist, scares me more than the article. There must be cautious optimism in order to work towards decreasing our impact on the planet. 
                       <br><br>

I fully acknowledge that humans have contributed to climate change, but there are a couple flaws I find in his writing. He explains that the temperature is 121 degrees as he’s writing this article one day (II. Heat Death). However, that doesn’t demonstrate climate change, so climate and weather must be defined. Climate is the patterns of weather in a particular area over a long period of time. Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time regarding, heat, dryness, sunshine, wind, rain (Merriam-Webster). So, if one day has a temperature of 121 degrees, but most other days are within the average based on past recordings, then that 121 rating is simply an outlier. His statement is irrelevant to the main issue, that the earth will become hotter, evidenced through more frequent heat waves, beginning a record of what may become a long term pattern – climate. 
                       <br><br>

I also disagree with his bleak viewpoint on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Clearly, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions needs to decrease, and CCS is part of that solution. He doesn’t describe the process in detail, as it is quite complex, but further mention of it may provide some motivation to pursue that technology further. 
                       <br><br>

The most compelling piece of his article was his detail on unbreathable air. Looking back to 2017, the year of the Thomas fire California, I remember seeing ash fall like snow, and knew the toxins released due to the fire were affecting my health. Like Wallace-Wells states, more burning means, more warming, and more  in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide would displace oxygen as the atmosphere reaches an equilibrium, so our respiratory system would consume less oxygen, which is needed to survive. This would certainly lead to adverse respiratory effects. 
                       <br><br>

Though I found a couple issues with how Wallace-Wells presents information, the description of each possible event is very compelling. Implementation of solutions may provide the audience with a better view of the future and motivation to accomplish goals that would decrease the effects of climate change.

“The uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was not merely an interesting read but an enlightening read that not only prompted my own self-reflection but also incited a deep desire to alter the way in which I live today. Prior to reading this I quite mistakenly thought I was educated enough about the dangers of climate change and increased carbon emissions like soil erosion, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification; however, I was quickly shown that those effects were barely scratching the surface. While this article did, in fact, make me feel alarmed, I would seldom bracket Wallace-Wells or any climate change activist into the label ‘alarmist’. This is because the dire situation at hand is in fact extremely alarming and until we as a planet have taken serious action to rectify our wrong-doings no amount of alarm is sufficient. These scientists thus that are euphemizing the climate crisis for the general public are doing the world a major disservice and allowing the skeptics to remain stagnant in their beliefs. The grave detail, not only in terms of statistical values but of general minute details about all the different probable consequences added another layer of potency to the argument. Words and phrases that no human should want to hear about their earth were littered throughout the article: “Heat Death”, “Unbreathable air”, “The End of Food”, “Climate Plagues”, “Perpetual War” and “Permanent Economic collapse”. Here, Wallace-Wells ingeniously highlights the consequences of the climate crisis from every single aspect of life: social, biological and economical. This, therefore, allows everyone reading to engage with the material in one way or another. For me personally, coming from the Middle East the most propelling consequence I found was “Heat Death”. This is because walking outside just from the house door to the car during summer, already feels like torture and I simply cannot fathom or I do not want to imagine what that will feel like after an additional rise in temperature. Therefore, it is very plausible in my opinion that “Heat Death” will certainly continue to occur (since I’ve seen the damage heat waves do already) if we do not immediately attempt to rectify the situation.

As others have pointed out, Wallace-Wells can easily be classified as an alarmist. The fact that he is quick to point out most of the worst-case scenarios and uses most of these apocalyptic predictions to back up his claims is certain to instill a sense of fear in the reader akin to that of a thriller novel. However, this sense of fear is crucial to achieving his purpose which is to get a complacent, ignorant society to act on the catastrophic problem we have all collectively created over the past four hundred years. The way he presents the situation parallels a mother telling her children to brush their teeth or otherwise their teeth will rot and fall out. In both scenarios, the fear of a horrendous possible (although unlikely) outcome serves as the main motivator for action. 
                       <br><br>
Out of all his arguments, the most interesting to me was that of fossil capitalism. In school, I had always been told that trade and technological advancements were responsible for the economic growth of the past several centuries. However, Wallace-Wells' analogy of the single-use injection of power into our economy completely shifted my perspective on the issue. Fossil fuels have artificially inflated our economy into an unsustainable state and in their absence, our economy will crash. I thought of it as a Heroin injection for our global society. This shot made us feel good and achieve things we never thought possible, but now we are addicted, have destroyed our body and are heading into a hard withdrawal. Without rehab (human intervention) we are destined for a very bad outcome.

"The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells gave a scary image of what our future will be like if we don't respond quickly to global warming. He talks about how global warming will cause less food to be grown, more people to be displaced by rising temperatures and sea levels, and more devastating wildfires to occur. In California we suffer every year from fires exacerbated by global warming. 
                       <br><br>

I think Wallace has to be an alarmist in order to gain attention at the dangers of climate change. However, his words are meaningless if we do nothing to solve the problem. Learning about climate change is nice but if the people in charge don't care then nothing will happen. The only way to turn back climate change is to vote for people that will combat it. 
                       <br><br>

I think the most compelling part of Wallace's article was about the loss of food. We might have a population of 10 billion by 2050 which will only cause a greater demand of food. Since growing temperatures decrease crop yields and droughts occur more frequently, we will not be able to feed everyone. Knowing that lots of people will be without food is a scary thought. There will probably be wars as countries fight for more land for crops.

Just before I chose to take this class, I barely started to grow more conscious about the planet's crisis that is slowly but surely putting humanity in danger. It actually started after Hasan Minhaj made an episode talking about fast fashion in his show, The Patriot Act, ever since I finished that episode, it embarked a desire in me to do something about it by growing more environmentally conscious about my actions and further educate myself and others about the topic. Similarly, reading Well's article invoked the same reaction in me. The impact of the shared information wouldn't have been so significant to me if it wasn't for the quality, quantity, and emphasis. Wells used an abundant amount of data coming from a variety of studies and research for the sole purpose of educating the audience on why this is an issue of concern. Yes, he used terrifying scenarios which are unlikely, but considering the unpredictability of the future, who really knows how far he is from reality? Rather than saying he is exaggerating a danger for needless worry or panic, I think his main goal was to emphasize a very real crisis that we must panic and worry about.

Prior to reading David Wallace-Wells' article, I hadn't given climate change too much thought. I understood that climate change is a real issue, I just never put in the time to get a good grip on the reality of it. Reading through the article , the dilemma of climate became increasingly a reality. From the point of view of someone with little knowledge about the facts of climate change, Wells seems like an alarmist in "The Uninhabitable Earth," solely due to the sheer magnitude of the perilous futures Wells discusses. What's interesting to me is that this article was extremely alarming, yet as various other commenters have pointed out, Wells doesn't quite fit the alarmists definition as he's simply laying out the facts. The article conveys the dire position our planet is in, without veering from the facts.
                       <br><br>

What's intriguing and worrying about the term "climate change alarmist", is the negative stigmas that come with it.  For some topics, it makes sense for alarmists to have a negative connotation. However, in the case of climate change, it is necessary to exercise caution. The negative stigma that discredits the points of people who are deemed "alarmists" by the public only adds to the problem. The more time people spend disagreeing on climate change, the worse it gets. Not only does it extend the time before serious action can take place, but it only fuels Wells' section on the increase in conflict correlated to rise in temperature. This section titled "Perpetual War" was most eyeopening to me, along with the section following it ,"Economic Collapse." These two brought a completely different dimension to climate change, ultimately bringing more fear than the previous sections. My limited previous knowledge of climate change was based around Earth warming and the issues that come with that, with the increase in violence and the imminent collapse of economies that Wells describes makes the topic of climate change more daunting than anything. This prompted an overwhelming feeling to stir in my head. This feeling of being overwhelmed was extremely scary, possibly more than anything in the article because I know this feeling is shared by others. After all, this feeling was short-lived, for me at least, as the last couple of paragraphs brought back some hope and brought me out of a fear induced coma. In the end, Wells brings up some alarming points, but that's merely the nature of Climate Change, and it will continue to be the case until it is recognized as the true danger it is.

After reading the article as well as watching this video it is very concerning how the world is responding to climate change. Nobody really realizes how dangerous our world is becoming and how much climate change can impact life on this planet. Calling Wells an “alarmist” is a bit extreme because what wells wrote is all eventually going to happen. He is correct on his facts and people are just trying to deny the truth that climate change is a real pressing issue today. The problem with society is the average everyday person may not be able to see climate change so they don’t believe it exists. It is like the “what they don’t see doesn’t hurt them” mentality. Like it was mentioned in the article, the country is dominated by people who don’t view global warming as an issue and some don’t even believe in it. I know even myself is a little guilty of this but after reading the article I realize how scary this actually is. Wells does a good job using his technique in scaring the readers because in reality, it is scary and real! He is trying to warn everyone of what might happen if we don’t change our ways and take action.

David Wallace did not waste any time with the beginning of this article, the intro alone slaps you right across the face calling for action. I joked around with my friends that this class depressed me even after the first class, but this article is what really did it. Wallace is certainly an alarmist, which I can appreciate but unfortunately many people can be thrown off by his somber tone. I have some very close friends who are already climate denialists, and I think the alarmist tactic will only deter them even more from trying to save the planet. I feel many people try to ignore that climate change is happening, and if they read articles like this one they will feel fear that the planet is unsavable, and will want to push the responsibility of action away from themselves. I, on the other hand (as I stated above) can handle Wallace’s tone and alarmist tactic because I like straightforwardness and I think everyone should know the cold hard truth, even if its difficult to hear. 
                       <br><br>

All of the sections were equally frightening and alarming, but the climate plagues was the most striking point and thus had the most compelling effect on me. It had never occurred to me that there are prehistoric plagues and bugs trapped in ice that when melted can potentially attack us, and our bodies wouldn’t be able to fight against them. Americans usually like to only focus on themselves (which they shouldn’t) but even though they think they’d be spared from these plagues, the tropics will “creep upward” and they’ll soon worry about the deadly diseases too. Since Wallace explains how because of climate change there will occur deadlier natural disasters, the difficulty of growing crops, a decrease in cognitive ability, a shorter lifespan, increase in risk of autism, death by fossil fuel particles, the increased likelihood of armed conflict, the increase cost of GDP, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and hydrogen sulfide, I can understand why he is seen as a pessimist. But he proclaims himself, along with many scientists, to be  an optimist, which brings me comfort and hope for the future.

In the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” Wells takes an alarmist approach as he is upfront about the harsh reality humans may face due to climate change. Wells takes an alarmist approach in order to evoke a sense of urgency from his audience, however, by doing so he risks inducing too much fear. As Wells discusses all the possible ways our Earth and society could potentially crumble, from the “1.8 trillion tons of carbon” that will be released upon Arctic permafrost melting, to the “70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog,” I felt less and less optimistic about the future (Wells). Although Wells was not necessarily pessimistic, the scenarios he brought up made me feel overwhelmed, and as if it was too late for me to help.

Although Wells may have fallen short prompting his audience to take action, Wells effectively communicated the drastic nature of climate change as he was straight forward about not only the various ways climate change is affecting us, but the severity of these changes. Before reading the article, I was oblivious to the ways climate change is already affecting daily human life. I was unaware of the fact that exposure to the ozone increases the risk of autism and that one-fifth of the population of El Salvador has chronic kidney disease due to dehydration. Realizing that climate change is already deeply affecting human health over the world, increases my concern about the issue. Hopefully society will soon realize climate change is already affecting us and will be prompted to take action.

The climate change is actually much more serious than people think it is, and it has already started. Are those sci-fi movies reflects the truth? Will people survived in the future while it is already really on the schedule? Should people panic? These are good questions that people need to think about. We need to cool off now because the heat is increasing around the globe. Deserts are much hotter today. At the same time there is drought issue. The ice is melting in both poles. There are diseases in the world, and whether the air is breathable or not is another issue. There is too many pollution and warfare now, with increasing social conflict. The economic is gradually collapsing, and the ocean is poisoned by human activities.
                       <br><br>
Some people are ignoring these issues while others are not. However, we still have time to save the future. Right now the data looks good but the actual is much worse. Will people fail to stop it getting worse again? It’s likely and possible that we will not, but there are still a lot of facts showing the climate change.

David Wallace Wells is most definitely an alarmist and while the eye-opening, and fear-stricken titles catch the reader's eye at first glance, the author makes no disappointment regarding the delivery of the quite terrifying facts. Taking into consideration how far the Earth's "doom" has progressed in a small amount of time, the sense of urgency from the residents of this planet has fallen far from acceptable. The author, while being an alarmist, attempts to deliver this sense of urgency to the readers and in a way is trying to scare them into making a change. Despite such a controversial approach to the problem, I think that this may be the way to get the reader's attention. He makes a point to relate with the audience throughout the article as well, making sure that while he is using a scare tactic on them, he is also trying to relate to the reader and build trust so that they may actually believe him.
                       <br><br>

By taking an alarmist approach, the author risks not being able to connect with all of his readers. He may come off as a bit of an extremist, and while he has evidence and valid points, some may see this as an over-exaggeration of a smaller problem. He makes sure to cover all of the ways that one may be effected, from diseases to food shortages, some people may still disregard this article because they do not want to come to terms with what the Earth is transforming into.
                       <br><br>

The most compelling of the dangers that the author touches on is the fact that we may run out of food. In a world where homeless dominate certain areas already and with an issue already very prominent, the progression of a food shortage concerns everyone and will ultimately affect everyone. 
                       <br><br>

Providing evidence on the Earth's temperature rising, the past effects of this dangerous event, and the future implications that this would cause is an eye-opener to those who may not know a lot about the issues at hand; as well as the severity of them. The water, food, and oxygen issues that prevail throughout the article speak to the reader as something that they're able to relate to because they are directly affected. After reading the article I am compelled to take action and promote change for this issue.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, Wells outlines a jarring depiction of the Earth and humanity’s future if climate change is allowed to progress on its current path. Although the alarmist stance taken on by Wells is apparent, through his pessimistic tone and bleak statements, I feel that his stance is justified. In his work, Wells highlights and criticizes the fact that scientists use jargon and carefully selected language to disguise the dire situation the planet is facing. Even though these scientists know the reality of the situation, they downplay it to avoid criticism and backlash, largely for fear of being labeled as alarmists themselves. However, if no one gives the public the blatant, unfiltered truth, how can we ever fully realize the degree of action necessitated by this crisis? Science and technology have so much to offer in aid of the climate crisis, but the world needs brutally honest articles if we want to meet our goals to reduce emissions. 

                       <br><br>

The section which I found most impactful was “Climate Plagues” which describes the diseases trapped within the quickly melting Arctic ice. In high school and online, it was always pointed out to me that when the ice melted enough, these diseases would be re-released into the world. However, I did not realize that with today’s transportation technology, and speed-obsession, deadly disease could ravage the human population. What I find even more frightening is that this plague would not be limited to diseases encased in ice, but diseases I see on TV everyday and never have to worry that I’ll catch. Wells points out that as climates grow warmer, tropical diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika will inch closer and closer to the US, and they won’t seem like such a foreign concept anymore. Something I find concerning is that many countries and organizations have to dedicate large amounts of money, labor, and research to preventing horrific diseases from spreading. If these diseases were to spread all over countries like the US, how would we be able to contain and stop it? 

                       <br><br>

Finally, Wells outlines two groups of people, “technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn’t even see warming as a problem.” In my opinion, there is a third group made up of people who recognize the existence of the climate crisis, yet feel that someone else can do the work, or that their contributions as an individual will mean nothing in the long term. For many years, I felt this way too. Only in months past has my perspective shifted, and I feel that my contributions, whether they be switching to a plant-based diet, or thrifting my clothing, can make a difference. I think Wells’ article serves as a call to action for people who feel powerless, and if everyone who reads the article has a shift of perspective, those small “meaningless” contributions would amount to an incredible force of change.

I completely agree with the points you bring up in your comment. The alarmist stance is justified and at this point, I'm not sure how much it can be classified as an alarmist since it is getting closer and closer to being the truth and reality of every day life. His critique of scientists who are almost sugarcoating the truths about climate change is well justified and necessary as we need scientists to be able to speak about their knowledge to the fullest extent so climate change deniers have fewer options to discredit the severity of the issue. Instead of people pleasing, there needs to be more articles like Wallace-Wells' in order to paint a picture in peoples' minds that they can't easily forget and dismiss. It is easy for people to say that the effects of the planet warming a couple degrees can't be that detrimental until it's effects are actually dissected and researched. And the effects he spoke of were truly terrifying. 
                       <br><br>
The part that impacted me the most was the end of food. With climate change destroying so many crops and making certain places incapable of growing food. The very real issue of drought, as experienced in California, is only becoming bigger of a threat. I fear that the lack of water and food are going to become the causes of war in the future. As places become unsuitable for growing crops people are going to be left with nothing and go to war just to survive. The resources people will be fighting for will expand from fossil fuels to basic food and water. As the most basic needs for human beings, it is certain that this will have huge impacts on the human population as almost 1 billion people on the planet already suffer from starvation and food insecurity. 
                       <br><br>
I also agree with your point of there being a third group of people who are aware of the issue but are waiting for someone else to fix the issue. That issue of complacency is one that reminded me of Martin Luther King Jr who called on the white moderates as the hardest group of people to overcome as they saw the problems with racism but simply told the black population to 'wait' for the right time and for leaders to do something. The biggest problem is not the ones that are directly against the issue but all the people who see the issue but won't do anything about it. These articles are needed to make people realize the gravity of the issue enough to take action, whether it be changing their lifestyles or voting for candidates that are also going to take action on the issue. Social movements do work and are needed to create change and these articles can help shift public perception and make change.

David Wallace-Wells’ article does not incite unnecessary panic or exaggerated alarm pertaining to the topic of the climate crisis.  For this reason, he does not express an alarmist point of view in his article but instead plainly lays out the facts in an attempt to spur action.  Although his diction in certain points of the article is incredibly misleading (i.e. “Doomsday,” “Heat Death” and “Perpetual War”) he is plainly stating facts without making any unrealistic assumptions or personal conclusions.  An issue as severe as the climate crisis deserves a rather shocking article in order to encourage very imperative changes to human life.  In fact, Wallace-Wells would be doing his readers and colleagues a disservice if he did not spark even just a little controversy using slightly alarming language in his article.  Without passionate, well-informed people like Wells, it is difficult to say whether or not humanity will come to a cohesive solution for this issue or continue to merely disregard its severity and the impending dangers it places on humanity.
                       <br><br>


Although Wells’ makes a variety of excellent points and incorporates a multitude of different perspectives, I believe some of his most compelling opinions are under the section “Climate Plagues” where he underlines the dangers of diseases that have been trapped in rocks and icebergs.  Wells refers to this as “frozen history,” and states that our immune systems would virtually have no idea how to fight off these prehistoric plagues.  These very compelling points add to the dangers of the climate crisis and support the fact that Wells is being objective in his point of view instead of alarming.  Because the idea of prehistoric plagues being uncovered at any given moment seems rather threatening, it is understandable that this commentary can be perceived as alarming and rather discouraging.  However, if we are not conscious of these dangers, there would be little to no motivation in attempting to solve this problem.

Prior to both reading and listening to the content from this week, I had what I thought was a pretty good grasp of the current climate situation, but I was soon mistaken. While I can see as how the Wells article could be seen as alarmist, I believe that was necessary in order so sort of wake people up to what is going on in this world. I was opened up to how many other factors were being taken into effect about how this world is changing, more than what I had previously thought. Personally I agree very much with Wells and think that while it might seen very alarming to people how much the world is in danger, it is something that needs to be talked about and dealt with if the human race is to progress. I still think its crazy that people deny that climate change is happening when you can literally observe ti going on around you.

I believe David Wallace Wells takes the approach of an alarmist in order to scare people into action. The way he foresees our future is very grim and narrow minded. He doesn't consider any situation where humans have found solutions to their climate crisis. Taking this route can certainly become a hit or miss situation quickly. I think this is a question of should we be using the tactic of fear to communicate climate problems, or should we be leaning more towards instilling hope in the minds of others. I personally believe we should be using a happy medium between the two and not just jumping directly to a doomsday scenario. After his article I felt particularly fearful of our future and what is to come, but it didn't completely incapacitate my drive to confront all of these environmental issues. However, I can understand why others who do not have an environmentally focused mind would feel overwhelmed regarding the scenarios that David Wallace Wells proposed will happen in our futures.



</p><hr>

<p>
Before I read the article, I already had an idea about anthropogenic climate change and how it is quickly causing fearful things to soon happen to the earth. But even though I already somewhat knew about the scary truths of this crisis, reading Wells’ article made it even worse to think about. The language he uses does scare people, but I think we need to scare people if that is what it’ll take to get people to listen. I think his words about how this article is just outlining our “schedule” is a saddening thing to think about. I agree with Wells that this is bound to happen obviously if no action is taken. I am pessimistic about the situation becuase I do not think enough will be done in time because climate change is still being questioned politically. The fact that is is opposed and questioned is worrying and sad because soon this “schedule” will be reality, and the people who didn’t believe it will have to face this hard truth. Overall this article makes me want to act, but I also feel that not enough people are acting, and it wont make a big enough difference to fix our crisis.
                       <br><br>
In terms of Wells being seen as an alarmist, I think he is giving us true information that is alarming, but necessary. We should be alarmed. Wells being able to list almost 10 outcomes of climate change is alarming and should cause people to worry. I think several of the outcomes he listed were extremely worrisome such as the climate plagues, unbreathable air, and our “weather”. The climate plagues that Wells listed showed how diseases that were supposed to be frozen away forever could potentially come back becuase of warming. Thinking of these diseases only bring fear to my mind because they date back to the years when we were not able to have cures to them. And because they are so old and have been dormant for years, our bodies will not know how to react to them, and we would not survive the diseases. Unbreathable air is another fearful topic to think about, especially because we are already suffering it now. The statistics that Wells discussed, mentioned how weve had so many wildfires, and they will only worsen by so much. I think air is the scariest one to think about because of the recent fires here in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles that have devastated us so often within the past 3 years. Lastly, the craziest topic that I was astonished by how crazy storms and weather catastrophes will soon become our “normal weather”. It is the scariest one to think about because I cannot imagine storms on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Additonally, the idea of how cities will soon be gone is scary to think about. Citis such as Miami, or islands around the world, could soon be gone.
                       <br><br>
Overall, Wells truly showed how unwelcoming our world could potentially be soon. It is frightening to think of these outcomes, and even worse to think about their timeline. Our crisis does not seem to be close to being fixed. It is saddening to think about how this will be our future soon. I think Wells did an excellent job at showing how “unwelcoming” earth will be soon. I hope by doing so, it will call to action  for many people.

" The Unhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells communicates a factual tone in regard to the future bearing of Earth's climate. In no way shape or form is Wallace-Wells being an alarmist. In fact, Wallace-Wells is simply putting into perspective what possible scenario the Earth could end up in if we do not act quickly enough. As a reader, one should definitely not be incapacitated with 'fear' or even startled by any chance. The global climate crisis is a major topic people have been aware of. It would certainly be opportunistic to conclude Wallace-Wells conveyed an alarmist nature when reading the article. Having read the article, I immediately felt disappointed by the U.S government. I honestly believe it was extremely nonsensical for the U.S to leave the Paris Agreement because of their own political and economic interests. Having said this, I have guilt as a human being for contributing to this issue through my unsustainable habits throughout my life. However, I know I can do something about it. From now on, I vow to: stop using my car for transportation,  start recycling, and quit ordering so many products online. 
                       <br><br>


Climate change deniers and skeptics are obviously labeling individuals like Wallace-Wells as "climate change alarmists" because they are simply insensible. People like these should be the first ones to be informed thoroughly about Earth's global climate problem. The array of issues that the global climate can produce in the near future is destructive.  The Drowning section in the article is particularly compelling to me. In 2100,  2.4 million housing properties in America would be submerged in water. It is 2020! We are talking about 80 years from now, a large part of the U.S would be submerged in water. Not only that, but certain places in the U.S could be hit by 6 climate-driven natural disasters. It is up to the human race to prevent the planet from becoming a flooded place. This is mindblowing and the fact that this could very well occur in less than a century brings huge worries to me.

It nerve-racking to think that one of David Wallace-Wells’s predictions could come true, or worse yet, all of them. His opening line “It is, I promise, worse than you think” made me question what is not being told. I knew before reading this article that the media has climate change in its back seat. Because climate change lacks drama, as Wallace states, there isn’t too much attention brought to it. If people do bring attention to the issue, they can be construed as alarmists. This could be the case for David Wallace-Wells. He tells his readers that aggressive action must be taken or else the eight events he discussed will occur. I don’t consider him an alarmist, but rather someone who is concerned with the future of this planet and is trying to warn people of what is coming without necessary action. This may sound odd but this article reminds me of the original movie The Lorax. In AP Environmental Science, I had to watch that movie and my teacher pointed out the sign that reads “unless”. While the fiction world was being destroyed in the movie the main character was building a store sign that said “unless”. The meaning behind this is that unless action is taken, the earth, nor its inhabitants, will survive. Going back to the article, I think that Wallace is trying to raise awareness through being blunt. He uses ethos and logos to evoke an understanding and realization in his readers to the issues of climate change. Through providing statistics and factual evidence, such as “...more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning...” (Wallace-Wells), Wallace informs the readers to the scary truths we face. 
                       <br><br>

In my opinion, I’m most interested in the “Doomsday” part of the article. I was unaware that permafrost hold carbon, more specifically “Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon.” This is concerning because as temperatures rise, the permafrost thaws, releasing carbon that “may evaporate as methane” (a greenhouse gas), that will in return heat the planet up, causing more permafrost to melt. This is a positive feedback loop, meaning instead of keeping the climate at an equilibrium, the planet will continue to heat up, enhancing the issue. Although I don’t really consider David Wallace-Wells an alarmist, I am alarmed about how large this climate change issue is. After reading the article, I felt as though I should be doing something to stop these disasters from occurring.

After reading David Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I feel like his main goal is to scare people into action. In my opinion this is not the best way to motivate people. I believe humans react better to positivity rather than negativity. Approaches that incorporate fear tactics are not as effective as forward-looking methods. Doom-and-gloom messaging doesn't work as well because it makes people feel like there is no point in trying so they become passive regarding the issue of climate change. To some, it may be so daunting that it becomes an “inconvenient truth” to them and they choose to ignore it. On the other hand, it is important that we do not sugarcoat the situation. The public is poorly served by those who try to hide the truth because they won’t understand the scope of what we are dealing with if they are kept in the dark. Sometimes alarming and sobering reporting is what is needed to make sure people are informed of what is going on.

                       <br><br>

There needs to be balance in the way information is portrayed. A conservative, watered-down analysis of the situation won't really bring change. It would also keep people complacent. On the other hand it is important to not be hyperbolic when talking about the possible consequences of our actions.

I agree with the idea that a negative doom-and-gloom strategy won't be as well received as a positive, inspiration-based message will. In Wallace-Wells' "The Uninhabitable Earth", we certainly see a dystopian, fear-inducing future image that's being painted by the author; while we've already begun to see and hear the unpleasant truth of climate change and how it affects us in the present, I don't think this kind of narrative resonates best with people who already panic from the impending crisis. Of course, if we maintain the status quo and do not impose radical change to our societal structures, the horrifying predictions coming from Wallace-Wells could well become true, but now we are speaking of a pragmatic approach to get the message across to everyone, especially the climate-change deniers and those who've surrendered to the fear. 
                       <br><br>

When I was a child, I used to think that the largest barrier between our wasteful exploitation and a more sustainable development would be overcoming the technical difficulties that prevent us from switching completely to renewables (or in this context, coming up with technologies that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions); now, I've learned that it's actually convincing people to perceive and combat climate change in a reasonable way, while our society is increasingly polarized by identity politics and misinformation. 
                       <br><br>

This is why I don't agree with the alarmist approach, despite the good nature of the message. This reminds me of the approach taken by certain vegan activists to block pedestrians from entering burger restaurants and threaten them that meat-eating is a sinful practice. While we certainly should curb our beef consumption, for both personal health and environmental purposes, such extreme campaigns will have little effective persuasiveness; instead, a more positive approach would be developing better-tasting vegan burger patties, encouraging a healthier diet, and promoting the benefits of eating less meat.

Something that was mentioned from the beginning of the article was that there was more than one mass extinction. This actually isn’t the first time that the earth has gone through a severe climate change. The most notorious was 252 million years ago when carbon had warmed the planet so much that 97 percent of life on earth was wiped out. This is so interesting to me because I had always assumed that climate changed was single handedly the result of human activity. Never did I think that this could occur naturally. The number of places on the planet that are experiencing dangerous or extreme heat has increased by 50-fold. Soon. Simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe. If there is a 4 degree increase, the heat wave that hit Europe in 2003 which killed close to 2,000 people a day, would become a normal summer. The sad truth is that air conditioning could help but would ultimately only add to the carbon problem. The crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf. It makes it even sadder to realize that the tradition for Muslims to make the pilgrimage every year will soon be impossible.
                       <br><br>
` Food is also going to be very hard for us to produce in the coming decades. The article mentioned that with every one degree of warming, yields decline by at least 10 percent. Places where grain is produced s already at optimal growing temperature, meaning that any hotter and there will be a declining of productivity. Not only is heat a problem, but drought might be even worse with much of earths most arable land becoming dessert. Much of todays places that produce most of the world’s food, will not be reliable resources.
                       <br><br>
 What scared me while I was reading the article was the segment on the ice melting. It was stated that right now, trapped in Arctic ice, there are diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years. Our immune systems would have no clue how to fight back. Apparently, in Alaska they found remnants of the 1918 flu that killed as many as 100 million people - which is 6 times as many that died in the world war. Scientists suspect that small pox and the bubonic plague are trapped in ice as well. Another scary fact is that for every degree increase, the parasite the carries diseases such as Malaria, reproduces ten times faster. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it.
                       <br><br>
 Our air is being polluted by carbon dioxide and is growing. It is currently at 400 parts per million and estimates to be at 1000 by 2100. At that concentration, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent. I learned from this article that inhaling a higher concentration of CO2 affects human cognition. Small increases in pollution is capable of shortening life spans by ten years. A pregnant woman’s exposure to ozone raises the child’s risk of autism. What I took away from the article was that no amount of emissions reductions alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster. Instead we should be putting our effort into carbon capture.

In David Wallace-Wells' article "The Uninhabitable Earth," a voice of panic is present throughout the entirety of the article. However, this was fundamental for Wallace-Wells to get his point across regarding an extremely pressing issue: global warming is only gaining speed due to the choices humans have made, especially in the last century. While reading the article, there were multiple times where I felt terrified not only for my own future, but for the generations to come. Because the issue is so vast yet not enough attention is paid to it by the majority of the population, I think it was necessary for him to use an alarmist approach while writing. And although most of that majority will  unfortunately never come across this article, it will guide those who are interested in being proactive in curbing CO2 emissions and changing their lifestyles altogether. I believe that currently, the only way to make people act on global warming is for those more educated on the subject, like Wallace-Wells, is to present the facts and show that this is a dire issue that must be acted upon. There is a response that a large part of the population has adopted: initially, one feels a sense of urgency to fix this catastrophe, but then believe that it won't affect them in their lifetime. Society has continued to shrug off the issue in the sense that they continue to grow animals for food, (letting greenhouse gas emissions spiral out of control) sustain the drilling and burning of fossil fuels, as well as poisoning our oceans, which serve as a large part of taking in CO2 from the atmosphere. As the list goes on, there is concrete evidence of this being the largest issue humans must deal with today, because our lives and the future generations depend on it. 

                       <br><br>

Although Wallace-Wells was extremely knowledgeable on the subject, I felt overwhelmed with all of the information given. Yes, he needed to prove his point with factual evidence, yet it seemed a bit long for an article to read at one's leisure. I think it would have been more beneficial to narrow down his talking points, because there are enough mind-boggling statistics that will force the reader to take action. However, he did not present a solution or give instructions for the reader on how to change, which would've been extremely helpful for someone eager to act. Regardless, he succeeded in opening my eyes to the many consequences of climate change.

Reading David Wallace Wells article honestly shakes me to the core. I did not know the severity of the consequences of our way of life. Throughout this past decade I heard about "climate change" or "global warming" but always brushed it off as something that couldn't really cause that much of a problem to us. That ignorance that I and most likely many others have is exactly the reason Wells uses such a in-your-face approach in his article. His article served as a massive wake up call to me. Before reading this article, I knew only the basics of climate change, I knew the Earth was warming up, and that our seas were rising but I had no idea that the heat could actually cause humans bodily harm itself. Wells seeks out to inform the public and therefore, for this reason, David Wallace Wells is not an alarmist. Reading through the article it is clear there are no intentions of causing mass hysteria or panic. Nor does the message that Wells wants to create chaos appear, rather when reading through his article it sounds more like a plead to the human race. A plead for us to wake up and realize how our collective actions are going to lead to our demise. 
                       <br><br>

After reading this article I feel compelled to do my part in buying humanity more time to hopefully fix our mess, but I also feel hopeless and overwhelmed. The thought that it is not up to me as an individual to save our planet, but a collective effort of all of humanity scares me. Suppose out of this whole class 25% of the students are actively doing their part in saving the planet, it will mean close to nothing if the other 75% continue with their ways. Applying this to the whole world, how does one help our planet when 10 others are actively damaging it? The solutions Wells lists and solutions discussed in lecture all seem great, but carrying it out seems impossible. In order for the solutions suggested to actually work we all need to be on board and hold those who have a bigger impact on global warming accountable I.e. the fracking companies, who are actively put us al at risk to satisfy their own greed.

I used to consider myself as a responsible citizen of the planet Earth and someone who was fairly aware of our surroundings and the environment as I often prided myself on the valuable environmental knowledge I had learned from my AP Environmental Science class back in high school. However, my reading of the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” had completely changed my mind because after reading this article, I was thoroughly surprised and shocked by how ignorant I was towards environmentally related issues and how much I still did not know about our environment especially about climate change that is quickly transforming our planet. My first reaction when I finished this article was fear. I had never such a strong and intense amount of substantial fear present in my mind that I felt so hopeless and frightened for the future of this planet and of humanity, of the horrifying consequences of climate change awaiting us soon.
                       <br><br>

The author has a fantastic point which he had stated at the beginning of the article, which is that the majority of people solely associate climate change the rise of sea level due to the melting of the ice sheets in the Poles that this is the first thing that would come to most people’s minds whenever mentioning the topic of climate change. I have to admit that I am one of those people who regard that the rise of sea level and melting of the ice sheets are the most symbolic outcomes of climate change. Wallace-Wells’s article serves as a wakeup call for many of his audience members, including myself, as he emphasizes the dire consequences of climate change and the resulting grim future of the planet and its inhabitants.
                       <br><br>

Many claim that Wallace-Wells is being an alarmist, but I think that it is necessary to be an alarmist in this situation considering the disastrous consequences of climate change that are inevitable if no immediate actions or remedies are taken. Climate change and its impacts are often overlooked by many in society because of the deniers of climate change, or people who refuse to believe in the existence of climate change, and of the uncertainty involved with the issue of climate change that many people are still unsure of whether those consequences will truly take place and that many choose to ignore the environmental impacts of climate change for now since they would most likely take place in the future. “The Uninhabitable Earth” shows that climate change is no longer a funny topic to be joked around with anymore but rather a serious process capable of bringing devastating implications. 
                       <br><br>

Throughout the article, Wallace-Wells uses numerous pieces of statistical evidence and facts and evidence derived from credible scientific researches to further prove the urgency of the climate change problem and the pressing situation that humans and the planet are currently under. His uses of these pieces of evidence are very effective as they construct a concerned, urgent tone in the article urging the audience to take action to handle climate change. 
                       <br><br>

Reaching the end of this article, I felt a new sense of responsibility to take part in the efforts to save our planet and ourselves now that I am aware and have the knowledge of the abominable effects of climate change if we continue to sit and push this issue aside. We are all citizens of this planet with the right and obligation to protect our precious environment.

Wallace-wells’ article was compelling and very well thought out. Many call it being an “alarmist” but in reality, he knew what it would take to make an impact on the reader. He is not causing “needless” worry on the audience, his worry is backed by scientific researches and repeated history. This article not only gave us examples of what might come but why and how these phenomenons will happen. The section “poisoned oceans” states what has already happened due to the acidic levels rising, along with that is yet to come. This was compelling and showed the readers that not only human life will die, but the oceans too. Planet Earth will be like any other planet in many years to come. The advanced lifestyle that we have accomplished will be wiped out if there is no action taken. I don’t think the whole article was pessimistic because he stated that humans are likely to take action in the future. Although the action will be taken a lot later than needed, many of the deadly worries Wallace-Wells talks about can be avoided. 
                       <br><br>

The most compelling worry to me was the idea of heat death. Southern California weather is already almost unbearable during summer months. When Wallace-Wells was explaining how the temperatures in New York will exceed the temperatures of one of the hottest places on earth, I was in shock. What does that mean for the West Coast? He does a good job of putting images in the reader’s minds about what could happen. Along with that, it is also stating that this WILL happen if there is no action taken, therefore it could be stopped or at least slowed down.

When I hear the phrases "climate crisis" or "the uninhabitable earth," my imagination immediately pictures the Twilight Zone episode "The Midnight Sun."  If you haven't seen the episode or cannot remember what the episode was about, the premise is similar to the contents of David Wallace-Wells' article. As the temperature on Earth rises past a point suitable for human life (although not due to anthropogenic climate change in this case), widespread death, famine, lack of resources, and crime begin to occur. At the end of the episode, a shot showing the temperature hitting 130°F then leads to what seemingly is the end---a planet so hot that all life on Earth ceases to exist. Admittedly, the way Hollywood portrayed the possible apocalyptic meltdown seemed too far-fetched to even feel as if it could ever occur in reality. However, after reading Wallace-Wells' article, this seems like a future that we could encounter much too soon. 

                       <br><br>

"The Uninhabitable Earth" is definitely alarmist in nature. The author brings up each of his points in blunt and often morbid ways meant to grab the reader's attention and leave a lasting impression. And in today's society, where the threat of climate change threatens our very humanity, this is exactly what's necessary to finally make a difference. America today is oblivious to the blunt and often morbid effects that climate change has (and will continue to have) on our planet. When we sugarcoat the severity of problems, whether it be related to climate change or not, these problems tend to get ignored and put on the backburner. The looming threat of widespread devastation to Earth cannot be sugarcoated, and as Wallace-Wells attempted to do, must instead be presented in a manner that instills a sense of worry among those who read it.

                       <br><br>

When Ken asked us what the most compelling part of the article was, I couldn't pinpoint a single topic because, in my opinion, all were equally as compelling (and to be quite frank, absolutely terrifying). The thought of death by hyperthermia from rising temperatures, suffocation from polluted air, starvation/dehydration from a lack of resources, murder from the effects of heat on crime and conflict, etc. are all scenarios that personally terrify me in equal ways. Yet there is one idea not presented in the article that infuriates me more than any of the other points. How can our society be so selfish that we consciously ignore the dire effects that climate change will have on future generations?

By definition an alarmist is "someone who is considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic."  I would not classify Wells as an alarmist. While he does come off with a harsh approach in his article, he only does it to appeal to the audience. Instilling the facts and wake up call is greatly enhanced when Wells is speaking in a harsh and fearful tone. It allows the reader to know the seriousness of the situation at hand. In the definition, it states that an alarmist is someone who causes needless worry or panic. While Wells is provoking panic in the world, it isn't necessarily needless. Our earth is actually warming up, the North Pole is melting, the sea levels are rising, disastrous and unpredictable weather patterns are occurring. It's only a matter of time before we are the cause of a mass extinction.

I can see where people are coming from when they say that David Wallace Wells is alarmist.  After reading this, you truly feel that the world has no chance at getting out of this situation, and you are filled with the feeling that nothing you or anyone does could ever make a difference to lessen our impact and acceleration of the climate crisis.  While this is the case, everything that he is saying is true, and this is the current state of the world with conditions worsening and humans continuing to add to the mounting issue.  We have not made any significant changes and continue to exponentially emit and harm our deteriorating planet.  If there was ever a time for action and change, it is now.  
                       <br><br>

His take on the climate crisis portrays it as an urgent issue, as it should be.  Often other projections and takes on the situation are conservitive estimates and people will still look at these as alarmist.  At some point, humans just need to be shown the worse case scenario of what our world is heading towards and the dangerous consequences of our actions.  For now, people stay complacent and continue on their daily lives as they don’t experience the impact of climate change.  The evidence is mounting and climate change cannot be denied any longer.  Continuing down this path is exactly what this was written to prevent.  Showing what could happen is being used to discourage humans from our current habits and to make sustainable changes.

While "The Uninhabitable Earth" was definitely a downer in terms of anticipating the global crises/catastrophes, I do not believe Wells is an alarmist. Though he is "alarmed", per se, by the impending consequences of human activity, it is not without reason and scientific proof. I think anyone who read this article would be incredibly motivated, as I was, to look into ways to help the environment and gather more information. While this article marks the tragedies that will happen if we do nothing, it also greatly emphasizes the need to do something , in order to prevent these events. In all truth, the article may be there to scare people into action, but the underlying theme is that these predictions are completely preventable, and the steps to ensure they never happen are there.

                       <br><br>

I do believe the "scare tactic" may alienate some readers, but those readers lack common sense in dismissing scientific reasoning. Wells provides evidence from a variety of scientists, including older work from Wally Broecker and Jim Hansen, as well as countless scientists throughout the essay. If people cannot fathom that this work is real and important, they can look at its history and find that these warnings have been broadcast for years and that the Earth is only getting worse. This audience that would react in this way is also stereotypically an older crowd, and Wells concedes this in his story about his parents by including that they were accustomed to a way of life, a "paradise supported by...an industrialized world". Climate change and global warming will not affect them, so they have no reason to believe in it.

                       <br><br>

To me, the most compelling of Wells's points was the Doomsday seed vault being flooded. I saw an informational video about the vault online years ago, saying it was infallible and was likely to be the savior of agriculture. To hear that it was flooded as a result of melted permafrost was incredibly worrying to me, mostly because only a decade ago it was proposed to be full-proof, and I had believed in it. It was shocking to me that it hadn't even made national news, and was never widely presented as a global crisis. It feels as though people are perceiving global warming as a debate, not an epidemic that is currently happening, and that humankind is currently worsening. It is treated as a political opinion, and to do that discredits the work many scientists have done to prove it. Climate change is actively happening and becoming a larger issue every second, and I believe it is going to take drastic and urgent action to prevent the future Wells predicts.

<p>
It is alarming that humans are solely responsible for the rise in degrees of the earth. I do not understand why some people can be self-centered enough to think global warming is a hoax. Seeing the bigger picture makes the 2-worded phrase "climate change" terrifying. Thinking about the climate that over 7 billion people reside in will change for the worse is very alarming. David Wallace-Wells does not snooze that alarm, as his article prompts or scares people to wake up to face reality and the facts. In The Uninhabitable Earth, Wells prompts us to act in our best interest and to do whatever it takes to survive. Even though he was extreme in some of these theories, one should not be paralyzed in fear and fail to join the force to save our earth. Even though some of the vivid, futuristic outcomes would make a home-run horror movie. The term alarmist suits Mr. Wells because his predictions activated many to respond and help when realizing the many painful ways of extinction. 
                       <br><br>

One sad statistic is there were 100 Billion Dollars in climate disasters, doubling the decade before. This is ironic because the industrial companies capitalizing on the damaging environment is causing a financial black hole in relief efforts and aid to suffering countries vulnerable to the merciless nature. Mother Nature, God, Zeus, or whatever name you wanna call it by is showing its anger with these geological catastrophes like floods and category 5 hurricanes. My most frightening scenario is the Climate Plague in which the ice melts from millions of years ago exposing diseases our immune systems cannot handle. Much like when the bubonic plague ice melts, these ancient viruses can become airborne and wipe us all out. It would be pretty difficult for the next Dinosaur species that evolves to predict how the Humans went extinct.

Before I read the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I have read some related articles about global warming, greenhouse gases, and the climate crisis in high school. I know that the climate crisis is serious today and will cause catastrophic consequences both to the environment and to humans in the future, but I never attach great importance to these issues and I never think of making efforts and actions to mitigate these problems, although it may not be helpful for now. This article emphasizes the severity of the issue and presents several possible consequences due to the climate crisis from different aspects, which states the main topic: global warming and climate crisis make the earth uninhabitable and inhospitable. I felt that the author’s work in claiming the facts and making plausible predictions about consequences that climate crisis brought is necessary and more people should know the situation we face today, but Wallace-Wells also causes horrors and fears to the audience, making people in panic and making me feel hopeless about our living Earth. It seems like there is no solution to change the situation and solve the issues. To some extent, I think that Wallace-Wells exaggerates the issue to make us be alert and pay attention, but I believe that his goals are good to alarm people and persuade them to understand the situation and issues and to take action.
                       <br><br>

The second part of the article is the most impressive one to me because it talks about heat stress, which I have never touched, and it is directly related to human deaths. People may not survive in the Earth due to the extreme heat. Wallace-Wells claims that “by the end of the century, the World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century”, which is shocking and astonishing. This fact scares me. The author provides excellent examples and facts to illustrate the issue and some of them break my beliefs and give me a broader view of climate change and crisis.
                       <br><br>

In general, the author posts a lot of facts and examples, attracting the audience’s readiness to pay attention to the issues discussed in the article. This article is informed and enhances the understanding of people toward the climate crisis and its outcomes.  The possible consequences are predictable and reasonable, but they may cause panic and worries among people. Although the situation is dramatically serious and extremely urgent, I still feel optimistic about the future and believe that the situation is reversible as people all over the world have consciousness of climate crisis and take action to prevent further deterioration.

Wallace-Wells is far from what Professor Hiltner defines in this video as an alarmist. In "The Uninhabitable Earth" the author, Wallace-Wells, states that the information within the article comes from many scientific journals and interviews. Therefore, the information he is presenting is merely a possible future for an Earth whose inhabitants do not make swift and meaningful changes to combat the ever increasing destruction of global warming. Wallace-Wells even states that it is likely that not all of these things will occur as people are often led to take action when the changes begin to personally affect them. This statement is one of the fundamental arguments to this entire article because it shows Wells attempting to dissuade his own personal bias as he tells the reader that the events could be reversed even sooner if we, humans, took charge and implemented changes now. However, as he states that is likely to happen until the affects are already fully upon the Earth. So, though the way Wells presents his facts may classify him as an alarmist I believe his intent was to illustrate vivid factual evidence of what will take place if people do not change, if facts are an alarmist strategy then the events that would take place in the future with a lack of change will be equally as alarming. 
                       <br><br>

In response to which of Wells' article segments I found most compelling I would say "Climate Plagues" intrigued me the most. The Climate Plague section was compelling in a sense that it centered a very real threat to the human population now which is disease and sickness brought on by plagues. The argument in the article was that continued heating would allow for ancient diseases, animal carcasses, and bugs to be reinstated into the present world. If this are to happen the diseases that could be presented would wreak havoc on future populations as the human bodies would have no resistance for the plagues they could be ailed with. This section was the most compelling in my opinion for the sole fact that, even in recent years, we have seen what sickness' such as the Ebola virus are capable of.

I found "The Uninhabitable Earth" to be a very thought-provoking piece that deeply addressed the issue of climate change. Wallace-Wells gathered many different viewpoints and opinions on climate change and its possible consequences to the livelihood of the planet and its inhabitants. I found it very interesting how many different aspects of the issue were presented, including the implications to society and everyday lives. For instance, the section on perpetual war was particularly striking. I never considered the effects of increased temperatures on an individual's decision making and actions. I found this to be a uncommonly mentioned analysis on the broader issue of climate change. As he mentioned the critics of climate change to not be as disastrous as claimed by science, there are implications of rising temperatures to the daily lives of the people that I feel are not fully considered. The topic of war seems to have a distant correlation to climate change, but upon reading the article, it is reasonable to connect the two together. This is something I found to be very enticing about the article in its entirety. Wallace-Wells brought up logical, well-explained arguments about the need for the people to recognize climate change as a pressing, dangerous matter and the call for action.
                       <br><br>

I didn't feel Wallace-Wells presented himself to be an alarmist. Yes, there may have been parts in his writing that seemed to only consider the most extreme scenario out of the many ones possible of occurring in the future. However, I feel as though this helps his presentation of points as a whole. I felt that one of his goals in creating the piece was to create a sense of urgency to the public due to the lack of reaction around this issue. Therefore, by focusing on these extreme ends of the future outlook on the planet, Wallace-Wells brings a pressing argument on the need for public action. 
                       <br><br>

I believe I feel more informed about climate change after reading "The Uninhabitable Earth", compared to my previous knowledge from the media or other classes. The article really opened my perspective on the planet's essential role for the productivity of society. It is more than just land on which we all live on. The earth is the foundation on which the people have learned to thrive and without it there is only a bleak future for the years to come.

Clearly appearing as an alarmist through his article, Wallace Wells succeeded to startle me personally starting with the first couple of paragraphs, but not enough to incapacitate me with the fear it provokes. Five minutes into the article I already had the urge to take action somehow because the possibility and methods to actually make a positive difference was effectively explained by Wells throughout the article. The fact that human beings are the ones responsible makes me feel completely disappointed but not surprised that people are easily capable of such things, but are not willing to put in the same amount of effort to help fix the world we live and depend on. Taking an alarmist tact does risk alienating some readers by scaring or dramatizing them too much, but in my opinion, it is the most effective method in convincing people to actually make an impactful difference. Although many of the phrases mentioned by Wells startled me, “heat death” attracted my attention the most because the simple use of the word “death” just intimidates me more as it somehow slaps me into a bigger realization than any other possible phrase due to my fear of death. This article, above any other reading I have done along with anything I have seen on the news or any alarming tweets I have came across, has had the greatest effect on my realization of how serious global warming really is.

Although Wallace-Wells’ article has an alarmist undertone, I find that it is just a projection of the worst case scenarios climate change can have on Earth if nothing is done. An alarmist is defined as someone who is causing unnecessary worry and exaggerating a danger, but in Wells’ case, I believe he isn’t making irrational conclusions. He is, however, explaining what could literally happen to our quality of life if our bad habits don’t improve. Because of the dire outcomes that are explained through this article, I can see why someone who is a skeptic of climate change would belittle the worst case scenarios Well’s describes because they choose not to give into the fear of climate change. Although the information Wells provides is relevant, this article could alienate certain readers because of the extreme outcomes that are rightfully pointed out. It is easier for some readers to live blissfully ignorant, or only hear the optimistic strides we can take to fix the climate crisis, than hearing of the negative effects that can take place. 

                       <br><br>

After reading the article,  I felt a sense of motivation to want to be a part of the change that prevents the worst case scenarios that Wallace-Wells outlines. Although the article is terrifying, the worst thing I can do is to have my fear incapacitate me. 

                       <br><br>

What is interesting about this article is that Wells dives into several major aspects climate change will effect on human life individually, going from how heat can affect human activity, to our oceans acidity, to even the diseases trapped in permafrost. The most compelling of the disasters Wallace-Wells explains is topic II about heat death. This hit home for me because I come from a city that is known for its intense weather in the summer and I was not aware of the extreme negative effects heat can have on an individual if it ever rose by even a single degree of warming in the earth’s atmosphere. The fact that in upcoming centuries, the heat can limit human life on the majority of Earth’s surface is very eye-opening.

I agree with the fact that the alarmist undertone is a projection of a worst case scenarios but the fact of the matter is that the longer people remain ignorant of the climate crisis, the more likely the "worst case scenarios" are possible. You are also correct in believing why people would seem skeptic because the worst case scenarios seem ridiculous to nonbelievers. I believe that blatant ignorance causes people to ignore scientific matters involving climate change but you make an excellent point in Wallace-Wells not reaching a certain type of audience because of what may appear to them as an extreme exaggeration of what could be occurring. 
                       <br><br>

Wallace- Wells while reaching his desired point alarming his readers to the most detrimental effects, also may have terrified his readers into a state of hopelessness as well. So, I admire your statement saying the worst you can do is let your fear incapacitate you from doing what is right. Hopelessness is the worst thing a writer can instill in his audience but at the same time his point is not to instill hopelessness but to motivate people to do more to alter our course. 
                       <br><br>

There seems to be a vast amount of consequences if we do not stray from our path. All topics mean a lot and all equally terrify me, from droughts that cause millions of people- especially poor- to die, to the unleash of diseases from the permafrost. The most devastating thing to me is that there is not just one major consequence but a multitude of consequences in which the blunt of people to be affected are those who did not contribute as much to the climate crisis issue to begin with. In our day to day lives a degree difference seems so minuscule, the difference between going outside when its 70 degrees versus 71 does not seem so life altering but the fact of the matter is that the difference in temperature is of utter importance.

For as long as I can remember, people have been warning us about global warming and climate change. I’ve certainly known about the dangers that define the future of the planet for years now, but I’ve always brushed them off, not because I don’t think they are true or important, but because the bleak future painted by all of these warnings has made me feel apathetic in the past. I felt as though a single person like myself could not possibly do anything to change the course of events predicted by scientists and climate researchers. Recently, though, as in within the past year and a half, I’ve personally gained an interest in both world and American politics. It’s no secret that today, climate change is a huge issue that is often talked about in politics, whether in the form of discussions like debates between politicians, or in the form of proposed plans and legislation such as the Green New Deal. The fact that I’ve become such an avid follower of politics, coupled with reading David Wallace-Well’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” has caused me to change my mind. I still don’t believe that a single individual like myself can change anything significantly, but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t try; and if everyone thought this way, I firmly believe that humanity could surely collectively bring climate change to a halt. I think that once you understand the details of how climate change can and will bring disaster to the planet, the sheer magnitude of such a catastrophe should inspire anybody to action, even if it’s in a small way. After reading the article specifically, I felt even more saddened than before at the prospect of this planet’s future, but it only reinforces my belief that everyone should do something, whether it is as simple as committing to recycling or more life-changing like altering your diet and campaigning for massive projects such as the Green New Deal.
                       <br><br>


I do not believe that Wallace-Wells is ‘too alarmist.’ Although I think that there technically can be too much of anything, I also believe that the severity of the threat that climate change poses to the human species warrants the kind of alarmism that Wallace-Wells preaches in his aforementioned article, the same kind that some consider to be excessive. In the same vein, while I believe that this type of alarmism does risk alienating certain readers, as in I believe that is the case, I do not think that this should be the case for the good of our species. Though climate change deniers do refer to people like Wallace-Wells as “climate change alarmists” in a negative connotation, I view the term positively. I believe that spurring others into action is something that should be done, and is something that helps increase the amount of people working together to try and combat this grave problem. I think that Wallace-Wells himself does a very good job in the article of raising awareness to his audience, and makes it very clear to them the possible ramifications that could come about due to inaction on our part. 

                       <br><br>

The scenario proposed by Wallace-Wells that I found the most compelling is ocean acidification. As he noted, the heating up and acidification of our planet’s oceans creates a feedback loop that only exacerbates the problem even more. I hear stories about the bleaching of coral reefs and it pains my heart; I hear stories about millions of fish and other marine wildlife turning up dead on beaches, shores, and riverbanks, and it makes me even more terrified for the future of the planet. Since I was a kid, I’ve heard stories about how the ocean is one of the biggest sources of food for the planet and proposing that the seas have the potential to become even more important as the years pass and technology increases. Of course, none of that will matter if climate change kills our oceans before we can even reach such a point. The note about hydrogen sulfide bubbling out of the seas along the Skeleton Coast and the historical ramifications of hydrogen sulfide upon ocean life also scared me a lot; so for me, personally, ocean acidification is definitely on top of my list of most daunting challenges that we will face as we move forward through the century, and climate change continues to get even worse.

I went into the reading prepared to learn more about the facts that I was previously unaware of about climate change. After reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I was profoundly educated, as Wells's article detailed the statistics and the reasons behind the climate crisis. I realized how unaware I was of the hard, cold facts and the alarming crisis that is being caused by humans to the environment. I knew that the carbon levels emitted into the air every year is causing destruction to our seas and our land. I knew that the ozone layer was rapidly being eroded away. I knew that ocean acidification is a major crisis we are dealing with. However, the intrinsic details that Wells's presents in about each degree of warming are alarming, and rightfully so. While others would discredit Wells by claiming that his article overly exaggerates and presents the worst-case scenario (if nothing is done about climate change), Wells actually provides a very realistic and action-provoking point of view. Even as scientists and climate experts continuously warn about the climate crisis, carbon levels are still increasing at an alarming rate, with no sign of slowing down or stopping.
                       <br><br>
The seemingly "alarmist" attitude that Wells takes in his article is to provoke action. The article provides hard facts without political biases or media clouding, and the severity of his attitude corresponds to the severity of the issue. Without much more people taking the stance similar to that of Wells, the climate crisis will continue to be a crisis, and people will not stand up and take action. While I, too, did sink into fear after reading the scary facts of Wells's article, Wells's intention is not to scare into inaction. Rather, Wells intends to scare people into action.
                       <br><br>
At least within the sections of Doomsday, Heat Death, End of Food, Unbreathable Air, and Climate Plague, one section should stand out and make one want to take action. Specifically for me, I believe that all of these are equally alarming and important, as they are interrelated. They might not all happen, but it is extremely likely that at least one will happen if nothing is done. 
                       <br><br>
I hope that others that read the article will have learnt more about the alarming, but relevant and necessary facts about climate change from this article. And along with reading it, change some of their daily habits to help with the crisis.

<p>
In David Wallace-Wells’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, his alarmist’s voice allows the reader to understand some of the consequences if we do not act now to prevent temperatures from increasing to two to four degrees in celsius. After reading his article, it allowed me to view climate change from a different perspective that wanted me to participate in reducing the Earth’s temperature. Although the article took an alarmist’s perspective, I think it was a good tactic to alert people about the dangers of rising temperatures on Earth because this would allow readers to think about how their actions would be reflected in terms of Earth. Sometimes alerting the public about the dangers of climate change through fear would allow more people to act on it because they would not want the next generation to be in a dangerous situation.

There were few keys points that Wallace-Wells had a mention in the article that I thought made a strong argument about the dangers of increasing temperature such as how if the Arctic permafrost continues to melt, diseases that were before the human era that was once trapped under the ice, would soon make its way to infect humans. Currently, we have no knowledge of what diseases are trapped, how it could affect our daily lifestyle, and how to cure/prevent it if it does affect humans. The diseases that are currently trapped could potentially wipe out the Earth but we do not know this until it actually happens. Many people may be quick to dismiss him because they do not think it could actually happen but their ignorance could lead to their deaths in the future. It is easy to dismiss Wallace because people would think “Oh he is just another alarmist climate change advocator that is trying to get famous with his article” but a lot of other journalists have been explaining the same climate change-related problems that can be used as evidence for his article. After reading his article, I realized the severity of climate change and how it requires people to change their lifestyles in order to preserve the Earth. To this point, many people still do not understand how severe climate change is because currently, it does not affect them directly but once it does, it will be too late to fix it. If we want to survive longer on Earth, we have to understand that action has to be now and fast.

I agree with your final point, about how the effects have yet to be obvious, and how when we realize them it'll have been too late. The notion of dormant diseases in permafrost is daunting. How can we be sure that those diseases could act as a mechanism for the "Great Filter?" Our planet will long outlive our tenure as the dominant species on our planet, and we are only playing with a hairpin trigger. Alarmism, to many climate change deniers seems like a radical viewpoint by a group of doomsday skeptics, but no matter how you spin it, inevitable death is terrifying, no matter how tangible it seems.

My initial take on the title "The Uninhabitable Earth" was that it was going to be about pollution and global warming. However, after reading the article I learned that the climate crisis is a complex problem and action needs to occur immediately in order to combat a lot of the disasters that will take place during this century. Reading about all the issues that have a great possibility of occurring in the near future made me feel overwhelmed. I think Wallace invoked fear in his readers rightfully so about the outcome of climate crisis. Just like when we were children, our parents would invoke fear in us when we were acting out by giving us a "death" stare or pointing their finger. Usually, this would result in a change of attitude. I think Wallace is doing the same thing in this article by invoking fear in his readers in attempt to change his reader's attitudes about the climate crisis, insinuating that we should act now. In this view, Wallace would be deemed as an alarmist because he is exaggerating what may occur in the future. Although alarmist are usually seen in a "negative" light, Wallace is going through these measures in order to educate people the climate crisis.
                       <br><br>

After reading the article, I immediately wanted to learn more about the climate crisis and what I, myself can do to not be a contributor to the utter destruction of our planet. It also encouraged me to reach out to local representatives about my concerns on climate change. It changed my perspective on how much of an impact the United States made when Trump decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. It was a slap in the face to the many countries that signed the Paris Agreement, considering that we are placed 2nd in countries that produce the most greenhouse emissions. I found "climate plagues" to be the most compelling disaster. Plagues are found in Arctic ice, including the deadliest plagues in human history: bubonic and small pox. This can result in a pandemic that may result in massive amount of deaths if there is no medical treatment. Wallace also mentioned how mosquitoes carrying malaria will reproduce rapidly due to the warming of the planet. I found this to be the most compelling because climate change can potentially result in a resurfacing of the deadliest plagues in human history.

Throughout my life, I haven’t really brought into thought the consequences that climate change could bring. But after reading the article “The uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I feel like I have a better understanding. Even though he may sound alarming, I feel that the way he expresses his argument is proper since it captures people’s attention really well. The way he conveys his message can open people’s eyes and help them realize how valuable the future of the earth is. Moreover, it can lead them to accept the fact that we are doing wrong but that we can do something about it. I was very shocked after reading his section on climate plagues. It even frightened me to think that there could be diseases that we may never see before trapped in ice. And worst off that are immune may not respond and thus could cause a lot of suffering. The article certainly had an  effect on me since now I feel more concerned about the issue. I also feel the urge to be keep learning and do something about the issue.

I too have not previously lived my life considering the consequences that the climate crisis could possibly bring. I only understood that climate change would cause rising temperatures, a rise in global sea levels, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms to occur more often and be stronger. I had no idea that there would be parts of the world that be uninhabitable. It's unbelievable to think that if we don't take action now that we will not be able to reverse all the damage that we are causing. What's even more astonishing is that some people still don't believe in climate change and global warming when all the facts and evidence are presented to them. I read through the comments on Wallace's article and there were some people that believed that climate is always changing and it's nothing we need to worry about. I think we need to start educating the public more on the climate crisis, which may need to start as young as the elementary school level, so that more people will hopefully understand before they get to high school and college. 
                       <br><br>

I also agree with you that Wallace's tone is necessary to capture the audience's attention and to get his message across. He definitely caught my attention from the very beginning. If he had written his article in a more positive matter people wouldn't be frightened by the future and they would just continue on with their everyday lives. Sometimes people need to be faced with graphic reality in order to be motivated to make a change. After reading this article, I researched ways I could reduce my own CO2 emissions and plastic consumption. I also sent this article to my friends and family so that they could be made aware of the situation and the effects that climate change can bring.

I do not think it was risky for David Wallace Wells to come off as an alarmist in his article. I think he did the right thing to mention words such as "death", "plague", "collapse", "war," and "the end" in the subtitles within his article, as those are surely the things that could happen in the future if we continue our “business as usual” behavior. These words surely attract readers who might otherwise disregard his writing. In his article, I found heat death the most compelling. He mentioned that at seven degrees of warming, in places where humidity tops 90 percent, moving around outside when it is 105 degrees would be lethal. He mentions how the human body would be cooked inside out. This really caught my attention. I didn't understand how that could be possible, so I did some research. I researched at what temperature at which you must cook a chicken. The internet said 140 degrees Fahrenheit. So, I didn’t understand what Wells meant when he said we could be cooked at 105 degrees. First of all, we are not exothermic. We are living, breathing organisms. We are endothermic and we can perform homoeostasis to cool down our bodies. Second of all, human bodies are a lot bigger than chicken breasts. Then I realized that perhaps Wells was exaggerating when he said the human body would be cooked through. Instead, he might have just meant that it would not be able to withstand that specific combination of temperature and humidity and would die due to inability to adapt. While the idea of heat death confused me for a while, it really made me think. It was a good tactic on Wells' part to intrigue the reader. In my case, I started thinking about what humans lack: a lot. Humans' brains are very well developed, however our bodies have yet to be as strong as Earth itself. Without our brains, we are no more than a chicken -- and according to Wells', we'll pretty much cook like one too. Wells' article was jarring but necessary. It does more than present facts; it taps into the fear factor. Since many people do not believe in the dangerous consequences of climate change, in the end it is beneficial to scare them into belief and action.

When reading David Wallace-Well's article, "The Uninhabitable Earth", I was struck by how negatively he painted the picture.  Many would call him an alarmist, which is true to an extent.  However, it is key to point out that the term 'alarmist' is defined as "someone who is considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic."  I do not believe this was Well's goal and in fact, he points out that he is merely discussing one possible scenario.  Furthermore, it is not even the worst case scenario.  Where I believe Wells strayed into the territory of being an alarmist is when he wrote the secondary title and first paragraph.  Those parts are meant to shock and frighten rather than inform, which is much closer to the stated definition of alarmist.  Though I understand this is likely a tactic to hook the reader, I do not think that excuses the alarmist style.  My question would be, why would Wells, who writes a lot of great content about the individual issues later on feel he needed to sound alarmist at the beginning?  In other words, what is the benefit of being an alarmist, especially when you have rational content later on in the article that paints a potentially less bleak picture?
                       <br><br>


To his credit, Wells later mentions that his predictions are what could happen 'absent aggressive action'.  Furthermore, each individual section covered a potentially serious problem and shows how they could happen together.  For example, rising temperatures could lead to food shortages which could lead to more violence, though I question the conclusion that heat in particular leads to violence.  He also talks about certain problems we have no solution for such as the reintroduction of old diseases or the widespread die off of plant and animal diversity.  
                       <br><br>


After reading this, I was certainly more concerned for the potential issues we could face in the next 20-30 years.  Furthermore, I believe that some portion of this is inevitable.  That is to say, nothing we do will prevent certain issues from occurring, such as the die off of species in the oceans.  Unfortunately, many people who need convincing of the severity of the situation are the people who would dismiss this entire article as alarmist, instead of just parts of it.  This is why I question the effectiveness of this article, as it does not communicate the issue in a manner that a denier or even unsure individual would accept.  I will say that the follow up article posted last December is a much better version that more accurately reflects the situation without all the so called 'fear mongering'.  Also, the annotated version of this article was a nice read, as it allowed Wells to argue with other prominent scientists and justify some of his views and even his decision to be somewhat 'alarmist'.

Throughout reading the article, The Uninhabitable Earth, I feel as if David Wallace Wells took an extremely alarmist approach in order to reach his readers. I feel as if this approach is successful and crucial in raising awareness to the issues that our world has encountered, is encountering, and will encounter in the years to come due to climate change. By using this approach, he is able to scare readers into changing their everyday actions to help save the planet. Along with this, this approach also encourages people to become climate activists as he is shedding light on the detrimental effects of climate change on civilization. I agree with his alarmist method of writing because I feel as if people will never fully grasp the horrors of climate change without it. It is necessary to inform and encourage everyone to urgently do their part in halting climate change. 
                       <br><br>

In this article, Wells talks about 9 potential issues that can happen if we don’t do something about climate change. I have not taken any classes on climate change, so each one of these issues I read about was new and terrifying. Specifically, the one that shocked me the most was the poisoned oceans section. Growing up, a main component of global warming that I was taught was the sea level rise. The idea of the oceans actually being detrimental to us was never taught. It shocked me how much of what was in this article was something I had never learned or heard of which made me realize that if I don’t know much about climate change, I bet many others don’t either. The poisoned oceans section alarmed me because of the potential cyclical cycle it could go through of killing fish, ecosystems, land, and people. Along with this, the ocean rising will wipe out major cities and people which will affect the global economy. Reading all of the effects that each effect of climate change has on so many vast aspects of our world astounds and terrifies me. I think there needs to be more alarmist articles out there in order to inform more people about our potential future. The preceding 8 other potential causes to climate change are equally just as prevalent and frightening to me. 
                       <br><br>

This article prompted me to take action in changing the way I live my life. I have always said I wanted to switch to a plant based diet, but have never actually made the switch. I have always said I wanted to stop buying fast fashion, but always found myself online shopping. And I have always said I would do everything in my power to contribute to stopping climate change, but always found life getting in the way. This article pushed me to actually make the changes in my life to do everything in my power to prevent our Earth from those 9 deadly issues mentioned in the article.

After reading David Wallace Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I first felt defeated after tying together the different adverse effects that unmonitored global warming will have on all living species, human societies, and all environmental landscapes and ecosystems. It was troubling to read the piling of consequences that we will inevitably face, no matter the steps we choose to take today. Being a somewhat experienced environmental studies student, most of the information Wells relayed in this article was not particularly new to me, but it was a reminder that there are some events our planet cannot escape because of exploitation that humans have already committed. Someone who does not have a background in this area would most likely be very overwhelmed by the pessimism and extremism with which Wells is describing the climate crisis. I would urge people to follow up on Wells’ next article, “We’re Getting a Clearer Picture of the Climate Future — and It’s Not as Bad as It Once Looked.” It is important to look at things from afar every now and then to recenter ourselves within the broader context. Although having the information alone is not enough to persuade people to change their beliefs or behavior, it is a necessary place to start.

After reading “The Uninhabitable (or at least unwelcoming) Earth made me pretty pessimistic towards the climate crisis, David Wallace-Wells takes the role of an “alarmist” climate activist. I would not say that he is effectively scaring his audience to take action, because the audience who is going to read this piece of written, environmental literature, and is most likely already making change and are aware of this crisis. But his alarmist tone could create a feeling of fear on someone who is not as knowledgeable on the climate crisis. He effectively uses the literary devices of pathos to create a spark of strong change within the audience, whether that be an environmental expert or an enviornmental ammature, trying to educate themselves on the climate crisis. 
                        <br><br>
But the use of trying to scare the audience could be ineffective in a way it could make one shut down. The way he comes across as an “alarmist” could make the audience that he is personally attacking them, making them shut down and not take in the knowledge he is trying to give them, and lose the spark he is trying to evict. Also the way he describes this doom could make the audience feel like own environmental downfall is inevitable and therefore there is nothing they can do to reverse it. Personally it sparked change in me, granted it made me more pessimistic, but as someone who is an environmentalist and makes many lifestyle changes to help the environment, it made me want to make even more changes so I can do my part in slowing down climate change.

The Uninhabitable Earth by Wallace provides me with a comprehensive insight into what would likely happen in the near future if we don’t make significant improvement in climate change. As the US quitting the Paris agreement, it was almost impossible to meet the goal to restrict the world temperature rise within 1.5 degrees. Therefore, the assumption that Wallace made about 2-4 degrees of temperature rise is entirely reasonable, and the consequences he presented are likely to happen. When I first read the passage, I was deeply shocked by the possible scenarios that may be caused because of climate change. The devastation and  catastrophes are from all perspectives: from diseases, food supply, to economics, and ocean acidification. I have been informed of climate changes for a long time, but I haven’t read a passage so  rigorous logically while deriving such terrifying sceneries. At first, I was quite reluctant to accept his ideas as I began to question whether Wallace’s fatality and pessimistic attitude exaggerated the possible outcome. However, the professor provided robust evidence that these terrifying events were just happening during the past decades. Temperature was rising, hurricanes were increasing, sea ice were melting, flood was increasing, money was spent, and carbon emission remained enormous in the decades. Then I begin to think again about Wallace’s passage, and I am now fully convinced by his viewpoint and fully accept his scenario about what we will be facing in the future if nothing significant takes place. Additionally, Wallace wrote the passage to appeal for increasing attention and engagement in environmental problems. Therefore, in order not to let readers “ sit down and cry”, Wallace did intentionally add a part at the end of his passage. He showed that most experts were still optimistic towards the ingenuity of humans by referring to the ozone layer problem. I am greatly fueled by this part and realize that if action is to be taken, we can still save our planet and minimize the loss.

Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth," was a shocking read and I would 100% categorize him as an alarmist. However, I find that being an alarmist in this issue is not only helpful, but necessary at this point in time. His article made points that are legitimately scary to readers, especially those in their twenties and below, as they are the ones who would endure the horrors Wells laid out. There is so much indifference when it comes to the climate crisis, that it is essential to scare people into action. However, a problem with this is that by stating the most dire of consequences we could face, many could discredit his work when a certain result does not occur and take even less action than before, believing his words to be lies. This is why I believe the annotated version of his article should be read as he addresses the fact that he wrote basically a worst case scenario, and people won't believe that they are being fed lies.
                        <br><br>


In my reading of his article, I felt spurred to action in every section of the reading, however, the one that scared me the most and made me feel like I really needed to take action in some way was the section about heat death. The fact that with global warming, moving in some places on Earth could effectively be a death sentence due to human's heat-making bodies that need to cool off. Another point that scared me was that with 11-12 degrees of warming, around 50% of the human population would die. I recognize that this is worst case scenario, and in order to reach the 7 degrees stated that could make some places uninhabitable, or the 11-12 degree mark stated above, there would have to have been a terrible mistake on behalf of the human race for not implementing a strategy to avoid getting this far, as we are already worried about reaching the 1.5-2 degree mark. However, I am glad to be informed that this is the path we are on, not because I want us to reach that point, but because letting people in on the knowledge of our current trajectory is the only way to get any action. This is especially true in places like the United States, where there is the second most greenhouse gas emissions, yet many of its residents do not see the current effects of climate change, while places like the tropics, who don't contribute nearly as much to climate change, are literally DYING because of it. Thus, I am very supportive of the alarmist take on the climate crisis and deem it necessary to inform the people on our worst case scenario and to jolt people into action where people may have thought they didn't need to act.

David Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth” suggests a wide range of potential consequences of climate change, which conveys the emergency of the need in public awareness and practical actions regarding climate change. 

                        <br><br>

After reading this article, I was amazed by some of the power of possible devastating conditions. For instance, the melting of Arctic permafrost may contribute to powerful and harmful emissions that even encourage ancient plagues. As the global temperature keeps increasing, more diseases stored in ice, and more parasites survive. Livings on earth are exposed to those threats, which may result in death or severe illness. Besides, due to the unbreathable air and extreme heat, chronic kidney disease and respiratory disease could be some health concerns. Additionally, food shortage, drought, ocean acidifications, and more frequent tsunamis will all impact our lives more directly and significantly. 
                        <br><br>


Not only just humans are affected by climate change, but also those animals who suffer to find food or survive due to climate change effects. We are currently in the Sixth mass extinction. While some of the scientists remain positive that technology will get us out of the problem, some other scientists believe that keeping the rising temperature below 2 degrees can no longer solve the problem. Therefore, we should begin to at least change our lifestyle and gather people together to fight for environmental campaigns. However, communication and conveying the message effectively has always been a problem for environmental issues. There are still many people denying anthropocentric climate change, which requires a lot of effort to communicate with the public efficiently.

From the beginning of this article, it was clear that the author meant business. I was especially moved by it because the author states that terrors that are possible as a result of global warming will occur within the lifetime of a teenager today. This is a smart thing to do because it creates a sense of urgency considering the fact that it will personally affect a large part of the population today. The first thing that stood out to me was how the North Pole was 60 to 70 degrees warmer than normal, which is horrific in itself considering the effects on the permafrost but how on top of that, the water flooded a global food bank that was nicknamed “Doomsday,” which was designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe. Even though the structure was secured, more flooding will happen considering how the permafrost, which contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, is melting and therefore releasing carbon and even methane (34 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas) at an alarming rates. This is terrifying considering how impactful a positive feedback loop is on our environment because global warming will get exponentially worse and continue to do so until a significant change is made in the way we treat our planet. 
                        <br><br>

Furthermore, I visited Miami in winter break along with Key West. I took English 22 last quarter and learned about how sea level rise will affect these coastal cities and I couldn't stop thinking about what a great loss it will be considering how beautiful Miami is. I found the fact that Broecker called the planet an “angry beast” that we are arming everyday interesting because this shows another perspective of it being our fault. We are giving the planet the ability to kill us by living unsustainably. To add on to this, the heat that is resulting from global warming is not insignificant. To think that there is a habitable place in the world that is becoming so hot that one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease is horrifying. Something else that stood out to me was how a lot of the most arable land in the world is becoming desert. Most of the places that provide the world’s food will no longer be reliable sources, which is terrifying considering how reliant we are on shipping food and how we don’t grow locally anymore. One of the interesting things that I have actually never heard of was climate plagues. If diseases that were trapped in Arctic ice circulate the air, humans would not know how to combat them, considering the fact that they have never encountered them. There are also bugs that are in this ice that are deadly when released. This could wipe out millions if not billions of people. With more deforestation and forest fires, especially in the Amazon which provides 20 percent of our oxygen, we will continue to lose oxygen and more carbon dioxide will be in the air. This scares me considering the fact that we have been having horrible fires all over the world, especially the one in Australia, that have been destroying our trees and outlets for oxygen. Another thing that I didn’t know was that hydrogen sulfide, which is the reason that 97 percent of life on Earth died, is in the oceans in parts of the Gulf of Mexico. The fact that this could cause a natural holocaust is very alarming. A possible solution that is interesting and less talked about is technology that would be able to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. While this would be expensive, it would definitely be worth it in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. I think this article definitely taught me a lot about climate change, which surprised me because after taking English 22 and Geological Catastrophe, I thought I knew a lot about climate change. I would recommend this article to a friend because it clearly conveys the detrimental effects of global warming but I would say that it did not make me feel optimistic, rather more informed.

<p>
A balanced interpretation of Wallace-Wells article would be one that considers both the factual argument he is making regarding the all-encompassing nature of climate change as well as the more emotional one: that through showing the detrimental effects climate change can have on our lives and the lives of others, maybe we will be in some way compelled to act upon that information. But, in my opinion, that comes at a cost. In Wallace-Wells own words, “aversion arising from fear is a form of denial”, and the principle emotion generated from reading the authors words is fear: fear for my life, my children's lives, fear of the future. Does that fear compel me to act? No. It compels me to hide in denial. What I think Wallace-Wells is really doing is making an argument about how the more we are informed about climate change, the harder it is to comprehend and therefore act on it that information.



</p><hr>



<p>
Before reading Wallace-Wells’ article, The Uninhabitable Earth, I didn’t really have an idea of where global climate change is bringing us to. I knew that our planet Earth is warming rapidly and that we humans are the culprit. The average temperature rise is greater, and unusual events take place more frequently, but at least we are surviving right? Such an opinion of mine changed after I read Wallace-Wells’ article, where he lists and elaborates on the specific consequences of climate crisis if we don’t act or don’t act immediately enough.

                        <br><br>

Wallace-Wells’ arguments on climate plagues seem particularly compelling to me. Many people know that a hotter temperature exposes humans to a greater number and variety of diseases, but very few would think of the diseases that are trapped in Arctic ice, the ones that “our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back.” We can imagine how disastrous those diseases will turn out to be, since we are so knowledgeable and uncertain about them. In addition, what really stands out to me is a conclusion reached by many scientists--“No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.” Climate crisis is an issue so comprehensive that demands more than one solutions, which may or may not work. There is no correct solutions, and I guess we just have to figure a way (or more) out, and each of us would need to do something.

<p>
The foremost conclusion I had after reading David Wallace-Well’s article “The Uninhabitable Earth, was that there is a great urgency related to preventing the dire consequences that our decades of mass industrialization will wreak upon this planet. While basing his argument on copious amounts of research, he forecasts the worst outcomes of climate change if action is not taken immediately.The terrifying prospect of the world descending into chaos via our own manufactured doomsday validates the assumption the Wallace-Wells is an alarmist. However, by predicting the worst possible outcomes, he sets expectations and also forces the reader to confront the peril, however great or small, that world currently finds itself in. Without the blunt honesty with which he writes, some people, as he mentioned, would believe a “sugar coated” fantasy that the world will fix itself without governmental and industrial reforms. The purpose of the article is to invoke strong emotion and to illicit a reaction, to mobilize more people to try to do their part to slow global warming. I must admit that after reading this article I find myself frustrated with the fact that I alone cannot force governments to change their environmental policies in the United States as well as abroad. However, change does start with individual choices. 
                        <br><br>

Throughout the article, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of irony with the fact that there is an estimated 800 million people struggling with hunger, and yet 30 percent of the food produced goes to waste and subsequently produces greenhouse gases. With the onslaught of climate change, the amount of food  produced with decrease by 50 percent while the population increases. The promise of more famine and longer droughts also was alarming. If we cannot manage the food we produce efficiently today and feed everyone with the abundance we have, I fear what will happen to the number of hungry individuals when the famines occur more frequently.

<p>
I have to admit that I am bit shocked after read this article. Before reading David Wallace-Well' article, I didn’t expect the consequences of our actions can be such severe and will come so soon, at least not big and quick enough to change our life in such great scale.
                        <br><br>
I was aware of the environmental problem that happening on our planet, the green house effects, melting ice sheets in north pole and the increasing carbon emission of factories and its affect-less protection policies. However, what I didn’t know is that the seriousness of those problems. Just as Well stated in the article, the greenhouse gases that is 34 times more powerful than carbon dioxide will be released in to the atmosphere due to the melting ice sheets. The lands that are disappearing caused by the rise of sea level and the huge impact on the food production. 
                        <br><br>
I think it is suitable for people to call people like David Well an alarmist, because he has set an alarm in everyone’s head by writing this article. However, I do think it can be better if he can come up with some practical solutions of how to solve those problems and prevent those terrible futures, because in my opinion, I don’t think that people don’t really want to spend their efforts to build up a healthy environment for themselves, it is because there isn’t any practical way to do it. For example, like the Amazon jungle, it has been destroyed by local people over the decades. It’s not because they don’t want to protect the earth, it is because that they need money, lands and resources to support their lives. How can they protect earth without having a better life of their own? It is not realistic to expect everyone to be rational and put their own interests aside. Thus, it is better to find a way to both solve the survival issue of the inhabitants and protect our environment at the same time.

The article, "the uninhabitable Earth", that we essentially read and pondered about is very controversial. Giving use concrete details about what life is like if we do not take action to prevent what human activity started in the first place. As I continue to read each sentence within the article my sense of hope for the sake of the Earth dwindles and essentially gives me no hope in the survival of the human race. Knowing that our own country is the main cause of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere and the reason why we are in panic of over exceeding the raise of a 2 degrees Celsius rise in temperature. With that rise we will go into a deep environmental catastrophe and life as we know it can go into a significant extinction. What comes to my attention is that many people are not aware, or they are aware and not doing anything about it. We have had several signs in climate change throughout the last decade alone. Including the California fires in which are the most devastating fires ever. Along with significant deforestation which diminishes our plant life which in fact gets rid of our main source of carbon dioxide absorption. To think some people actually agreed to drop out of the Paris agreement which in fact pertained to the substantial actions that would save a decrease carbon dioxide emissions to save them a quick buck. David Wallace calls to all our attention to make this out main priority in saving life as  we know it. People all around the world are making this topic political but it doesn't even have to do with taking sides. All must come to an agreement in which we can all benefit from in the long run. Instead we are watching the world come to its last days and doing nothing about it. We are running out of time.

Reading the article by David Wallace Wells really opened my eyes to the severity of climate change. While he seems to take an alarmist approach to the topic, I do believe that he is not exaggerating the dangers of climate change and is rather shedding light on the topic in a very engaging way. I was alarmed to discover the issue of insufficient resources or space for everyone on the planet as climate change makes several areas uninhabitable, especially with overpopulation being a big threat already. As global warming continues to grow even more rapidly than scientists assumed, how can we accurately predict what is to come? There are many potential dangers that we don’t even really consider when we first think of climate change, such as asteroids or human bodies literally being cooked inside and out. These things may seem like they came straight out of a science fiction novel but they could happen to us any day if we don't start acting against the climate crisis. Recalling the European heat wave of 2003, which killed 2,000 people a day, shows us how real the issue is and how deadly the effects of global warming are. The issue hits harder for those who work outside in the immense heat or those who live in areas that will soon be inhabitable. Personally, I live in Los Angeles, not too far from the coast, and it terrifies me that coastal areas are becoming extremely dangerous to live in as the earth gets hotter. In addition, the wildfires that have plagued our earth over the past years are very threatening and scary, but it seems as though most people don’t take it as so. Although Wells said in the article that we will eventually stop being complacent when the situation gets extremely dire, it already seems that the situation is getting extreme but many people still won't do anything about it. This worries me because then what extreme case WILL cause people to start taking action? Even sitting at home in the comfort of an air-conditioned house only adds to the carbon problem. I understand that many don’t want to sacrifice their lifestyle in order to help combat against the climate crisis, but we can do so by at least trying to reduce it gradually. Wells really opened my eyes to all the different possibilities of global warming, even ones that I would never guess, such as human cognitive ability declining by 21% as carbon dioxide in the air increases or even the possibility of war. I truly believe that social loafing, which is the tendency to work less hard when sharing work with other people, is one of the main causes of the climate crisis. To be honest, I used to think that my own personal efforts wouldn’t do anything to stop climate change, so I just relied on everyone else to do their part. However, learning about the issue and all of its dangers really makes us all realize that each of us needs to make sacrifices and find a way to play our part to prevent further damage to our earth.

After reading the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth," I am alarmed to take action for global warming. Wallace Wells depicts one possible result if people still are not aware of the danger of global warming. The depiction is visualizable, and it is given based on the understanding of science and global situation. One of the most impressive arguments is that global warming can cause not only environmental problems but also wars and human health problems. The article brought for me some new ideas about global warming. Global warming is happening, and it is going to be irreversable. A tiny improvement requires a lot of  human cooperative efforts.
                         <br><br>

When public attention about global warming was paid only to rise in sea level and greenhouse gas, it is hard  for the public to relate climate crisis to themselves. People in the urban area cannot really feel the influences of rise in sea level to their daily life. So  Wells explains the problems comprehensively from global relationships and the public health conditions. Wells also points out that all these results will happen in a near future or already happened. It is emergent for humans to take some actions to prevent the earth from being more uninhabitable. All the efforts we made for the earth are also for humans ourselves.

In response to you, I agree that The Uninhabitable Earth was an alarming article but due to Wallace-Wells overwhelming negative connotation to both the problem and his emphasis on solution, post-reading I personally felt overwhelmed and bit helpless. While I know this is far from reality, in that there are so many things I can do to help, answering the question Ken presents in this lecture, I believe Wells could have ended his article on a more positive note and emphasized the progress we are still able to make and not the progress we should have been making. In terms of the content of the article, many facts are new to me. Prior to reading this I assumed it was agriculture that heavily affected climate but now I understand it works both ways and another negative impact on climate change is agriculture itself and how it is meant to benefit our growing population. 
<br><br>
One of the most difficult parts of the article to read about was that of southern Europe’s potential to becoming permanently in an extreme drought. Having it be compared to the dust bowl which we have history of being a near impossible environment for people to live in should be a wake up call for everyone who consumes unsustainably, meaning again everyone. Yang, I’m glad that you recognize that while we are constantly learning about two major negative impacts of this issue, greenhouse gasses and rising sea levels, people don’t seem to connect this devastating issue with their reality. This not only makes people unwilling to push for progressive change, in many cases it even makes people skeptics. I think this is one of the reasons that I enjoyed Wells writing, because he is able to write about how it is climate change affects so many ways of life many had no prior knowledge to, making us more likely to relate to one of its aspects.

In reading David Wallace’s article, I do not find an issue with his “alarmist” tone, and find it frustrating that people expect journalists and scientists to sugar-coat the severity of the climate change issue. If we are not frightened or worried for our future, how will we ever instill any sort of drastic change in our lifestyles and consumption if we are not scared? If we do not show the graphic scenes of environmental degradation, extinction of wild animals, and point out the injustices caused by our choices in third world countries those who have the choice, those in developed countries, privileged, who have the choice to ride their bike or commute to work, or order foods from locally sourced farms, who live in comfort with a roof over their heads and all amenities included will not care. Or if they do “care,” it’s temporary. You can see headlines in the news about a whole city being bombed in the Middle East and easily go about your day because you do not see the devastation, the loss of life, the destruction of a community just like yours. Being an alarmist is almost the only way in a sense to capture the attention of an audience, and Wallace does just that. 

                         <br><br>

I feel as if his technique in giving the reader 9 different scenarios that are a result of our actions is extremely beneficial in getting his point across. This allows the reader to understand the layers that climate change truly brings to the Earth: it is not just the Earth getting warmer and pollution/trash everywhere, it is the inability to grow food because of drought and temperature, diseases resurfacing that haven’t been around for decades, and constant war and crime that will only escalate as conditions continue to get worse, along with a stagnant economy. I also found his use of the commentary by scientists beneficial as well, along with providing the annotated version to the article to further back his claims and correct his mistakes or wording, showing that he is confident in his research and work. This not only shows the complexity of the climate change issue, and how use of evidence can facilitate information to become misconstrued in a dire situation, which would be my only criticism. It is hard to sound impactful and pressing without using a bit of hyperbole as a rhetorical device, how when speaking of such pressing issues with such specific data, it needs to be maintained as best as possible.

                         <br><br>

This article not only exposes the intersectionality of climate change, but also makes us feel our future slipping away from us, which honestly may be the only way to aggravate and motivate the public to be in favor of a dramatic change.

I don't believe framing "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells as "too alarmist" is fair to the author's objective. Wallace-Wells was not simply trying to frighten his readers into action, but instead laying out the most plausible scenario if we as a society do not change our habits. It was a realist approach to a planetary disease. By laying out the dire consequences of humanity's action, Wallace-Wells has provided the framework for where change needs to be initiated. If this article invoked fear as a result of the facts, then the article has done its job by educating the reader. For me, the article reinforced my motivation behind the decisions I have already made as a environmentally conscious consumer -- at this point in my life it is one of the few changes I can make. But, since the audience of this article will vary in the type of response it will get there is no reason to attack Wallace-Wells for framing the article in the way he did. The "alarmist" tactic some may view this article as is not a true representation but maybe instead a self-projection of a reason behind inaction. 
                         <br><br>

The question "What effect of climate change did you find most compelling?" is an odd way to phrase the statement, since a majority of the effects of climate change seem to stem from atmospheric pollution; it has the most detrimental compounding effect. There is a concept known as the "long fat tail" which is simply the long-term effects of carbon pollution. Even if we were to meet the carbon neutrality goal of 2050 we would still experience global warming effects till the year 2100 (given that there are no breakthroughs in C02 vacuuming); a two degree celsius increase is a best case scenario for carbon neutrality by 2050. Given the amount of oil that is in the ground is already owned and ready to be burned we will easily go over the 800Gt limit set by the agreement. This is the most compelling and frightening effect of climate change by the sheer number of effects it will have and lack of action being taken to resolve the issue. 
                         <br><br>

The only criticism I have for Wallace-Wells is the lack of a plan or motivation for the standard reader to acknowledge and potentially follow. Even if he does not have his own idea for what an individual should do, he could have at least mentioned others who do have a plan. Otherwise the reader may fall into a pit of despair not knowing what their next step should be is. It is always ultimately up to the reader to decide for themselves but most do not take action due to the lack of a starting place.

Wallace-Wells' take on climate change feels extremely urgent, and I understand that many people may feel he is too alarmist. It seems to convey a sense of certain death for humans and the planet that may be off-putting for some. This sense of dread may be the result of worst-case scenarios but provides for the reader a very possible scenario if the correct actions are not taken. 
                         <br><br>
Personally, I did not feel prompted to immediately take action. I felt slight pressure to change some personal habits but have not immediately followed through. This is largely due to personal habits and an inherent feeling that my actions will not make much difference. I realize that this is not a great attitude towards the most important problem of our time; however, the seemingly certain doom and gloom presented in the article in addition to government and corporation inaction has provided a certain inertia that impedes my decision to take action. I do feel more pressure into beginning to make changes in my life, such as eating less meat as presented in the article.
                         <br><br>
I believe that the alarmist tone is not alienating too many readers. Many of those who do dismiss any alarmist perspectives on climate change are also less likely to consider less alarmist perspectives. Many of these people are climate change deniers and skeptics who refuse to believe that the climate is changing at all and would disregard a less alarmist take than Wallace-Wells’.
                         <br><br>
I found the heat death argument most compelling mainly because I have experienced a fraction of what has been presented. I spend a summer in Pasadena, CA a couple years ago. I would bike to work every day. It was already miserable at temperatures of 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit, sometimes more. I cannot imagine what it would be like if temperatures everywhere would raise even higher. The thought of simply standing outside being a lethal activity greatly highlights the idea of an uninhabitable Earth.
                         <br><br>
Another section I found compelling was the Unbreathable Air section. This is because how related the wildfire paragraph was to recent events. With the Thomas Fire and Cave Fire near UCSB in the years I have attended, as well as the Amazon and Australia burning, the world already feels slightly apocalyptic. I remember how terrible it felt to be outside during the Thomas Fire, and that would only be the beginning of more and more burning.

David Wallace Wells targets his readers through an alarmist approach. For myself I experienced feelings of both wanting to stop reading the article and pretend as if none of what was Wells was saying was true while simultaneously wanting to send the article to all my friends family and neighbors to have them realize how severe and drastic the issue of climate change is and the necessity of our actions. The approach that Wallace Wells took almost surprised me by how intense it was. He talked about all of the ways that we were going to be harmed by the warming climate so much so that it could make the reader just give up and say, “we are all just going to die anyway so why try?” I wonder what the author thought process behind choosing such a harsh alarmist approach was, and what he thought his readers were going to take away from the piece. 
                          <br><br>

I think that Wells could have stayed with the alarmist approach and gotten the same points across while being slightly less harsh. If he was able to do this he might be able to keep more of an audience. Also if he were to add some steps that we as humans and world inhabitants could do to even just help a little in this crisis we might be in a better place and the individuals that read this article could take the fear instilled in them and turn it into passion to take action. 
                          <br><br>

Despite the alarmist approach this article was fascinating, and incredibly informative. As a biology major all of the little scientific facts stood out to me and really caught my attention; The permafrost melting and releasing huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere, the equator temperatures rising by 7 degrees making it impossible for humans to cool themselves down at that level of humidity, the higher exposure to ozone in pregnant moms means there are higher changes of autism. These are all things that I later told my friends. So maybe that is what Wells was trying to instill. The more people that know about these issues, the more likely they are to make a change.

After reading the article, I don’t think Wallace-Wells was extreme with his predictions based on the trajectory that our planet is heading. The caption beneath the first image caught my attention immediately because I was in Costa Rica for a mission trip this past summer. I could testify for how the mixture of both high humidity and temperature could easily make you feel nauseated, thus constant hydration was the key to survival. I was surprised to learn that as Arctic permafrost melts and evaporates, it releases diseases and bacteria that have been trapped in the ice. In my opinion, this issue is more alarming than air quality, social conflicts, or ocean acidification because everyone today is more susceptible to disease mutation than ever before and it will be passed on to our next generation. For example, the rise of chronic kidney disease in El Salvador is a combination of both genetic and environmental factors. We cannot ignore climate change because it is not only devastating to the environment, but also it posts as a threat to our health.
                          <br><br>

From past EEMB classes, I’ve learned that we are currently in the sixth mass extinction due to the rate of species loss. I’m sure that most of us are well aware of what’s going on in Australia. Half a billion animals are killed by the fires and this number does not account for plants and other biodiversity that suffered as well. I believe that UCSB students can relate with this catastrophe more than anyone else. Two years ago, everyone on campus was evacuated right before the start of finals due to the Thomas Fire. Lives were lost from the mudslides that followed the scorching flames.  A year ago, my family was evacuated due to the Woolsey Fire in Southern California. Just this past Thanksgiving, the Cave Fire in Goleta forced classes to be cancelled right before the holidays. These wildfires are increasing in frequency and magnitude. If we don’t take actions now to alleviate what we have done to our planet, then where will our kids live in the future?

Having read the article by Wallace-Wells multiple times, the belief that his approach is alarmist continues to dwindle. The scenarios he illustrates in his article are terrifying, yes, but also rather realistic and we as individuals must accept the catastrophic environment we will have to live in during our life. I think there are people who are scared after reading this article for the first time, I was as well, but I would hope that this fear would push people to action. 
                           <br><br>
The only critique I have of the article is that Wallace-Wells does not help lead readers to resources that can help them change the current situation. There is no talk about how voting in elections can change the people who make the emissions rollbacks, nor is there any talk of ways that individuals can create change within their communities. I understand that the push for individuals to change their habits can be seen as controversial, but if not suggestions for that, I wish Wallace-Wells could have used his platform to direct people who felt called to act to organizations where they could get involved.

After reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I am totally shocked by the terrifying facts and his opinions about them. One thing that scared me a lot from global warming is the possibility of destroying the financial system all around the world at the end of this century. To be honest, I’m not the kind of person taking care of the environment in my daily life. But I do care about the financial markets. “Their median perfection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning globally by the end of this century.” I cannot imagine what the world looks like at that time. So before this happens, we should come out and help our planet. 

                           <br><br>

Another thing makes me feel sad is that most politicians of the world who have much more 
                           <br><br>
power and resources than others let it go this far. In my opinion, they still do not believe how bad the consequences are if we keep doing what we are doing right now.
                           <br><br>


Also, I do not think we should call Wallace-Wells an “alarmist”. By definition, an alarmist is “ a person who tends to raise alarms, especially without sufficient reasons, as by exaggerating dangers or prophesying calamities.” Even though this opinions are indeed exaggerating dangers, he has sufficient reasons to support each of his statement, which is also the most terrifying fact.

David Wallace presents the article with an aggressive tone to inform his readers of the detrimental effects of not taking action. Wallace is certainly an alarmist and his gloomy view of the future pushes readers towards a call to action. I do not believe he is too much of an alarmist that it overthrows his point for humanity to take action. Through his article “The Uninhabitable Earth” we can see the many examples of the Earth transforming for the worse due to human activity. It is scary that possibly at the end of this century, the world may contain lands that are uninhabitable and inhospitable. The ocean levels are rising. Climate change has contributed to four extinctions. Yet, even with this information, we are still not as concerned as we should be about this problem.  The information was communicated well and there were many examples of the different types of areas that the climate is affection.  Our food supply is also facing detrimental repercussions due to the change in temperature. The tropics are already too hot to grow grain, their current temperature is optimal if the temperature rises even slightly and an increase of declining productivity will be the result.
                           <br><br>


The air is also becoming inhospitable with a fraction of carbon dioxide growing and an increase in pollution can even shorten life spans by ten years. If this isn’t enough to convince the general population to change its ways, we can also look to the oceans.  Coral bleaching is occurring at a rapid rate and soon all the coral will die off. There needs to be a shift in the societal use of fossil fuels and general consciousness towards the environment. If a large change isn’t made, future generations will suffer the consequences and the Earth will become uninhabitable.

As I read through the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, I noticed a huge difference between this article and the previous informational texts I've read in the past. It is common knowledge that the world climate is heating up and the consequences are dire. However, throughout all the articles, the news channels, and the global conferences on the matter, no one truly understands what we are facing. Wells explains the severity of the issues by looking deep into the history of the earth. Using the previous mass extinction events as examples, he shows how the world has been wiped clean several times due to climate change. Each time unlocking the methane stuck at the poles and killing over 90% of the worlds population. I under stand why people disliked wells article and called him an alarmist for his extreme take on the matter, however I believe wells article is the only article that truly explains what will happen when the climate increases by drastic amounts. 

                           <br><br>

Think back to what you know about climate change and its effects. For my entire life, I've known that climate change is an ongoing issue and must be resolved or something bad will happen. The only things that can come to my head is that the oceans will rise, the fish will die, and the coral reef is dying. However based on human interference, artificial fish farms and other things seem to cover for these issues and rising waters doesn't seem that bad. Wells article dives into aspects that are new and very alarming. I believe that many people disliked wells alarming message because it brings to light aspects that they do not want to think about or deal with. They don't want to believe that they are in such a bad situation and come to the conclusion that Wells must be over exaggerating. Wells wrote this article as a massive wake up call and expresses that we must take action as soon as possible.

As Ken noted, to say the least, Wallace-Wells’ article was incredibly alarmist. I do not think I completely understood the depth of the problems which we are facing in our generation. The significance of the climate problems we are facing are incredibly large, and at times comprehending the scope of the problem is difficult. Reading about an ice shelf in Antarctica and directly feeling its effects lead to two different responses, which may be at the heart of Wallace-Wells’ intention with his article. Wallace-Wells focuses on demonstrating the debilitating effect which continued inaction will lead to in our society, rather than in isolated regions. This has the potential to affect people more than other methods of showing climate change.

<p>
Classifying David Wallace-Wells’ article as an alarmist piece results in conflict: some completely agree that his words are justified while others believe it to be overdramatic. I only partially concur with the sentiment that he is an alarmist. Yes, he is exaggerating a danger, but the panic that he’s intending to cause is not pointless. Adopting an alarmist approach is a vital step in educating the public and pushing them into action. Wallace-Wells accomplishes this task very well. While not all of his scenarios will come into fruition (at least, we hope so), evoking a sense of urgency and even worry is necessary. Fear is a dominant factor in our decision making processes because it is one of humans’ most powerful emotions, debilitating and uncontrollable at times. Fear is an emotion we possess, but without a firm grasp on it, fear can sometimes possess us. 
                           <br><br>

Although playing with peoples’ emotions regarding events that may not happen can be seen as manipulative, he does so to inspire people to change their ways before the damage becomes irreversible. We’ve seen daunting language used to persuade the masses time and time again in our political and social spheres. We know that rhetoric is one of the most powerful tools for change––from the speeches of presidential candidates to Tweets posted by celebrities. Wallace-Wells knew this and used it to his advantage. By employing a critical and urgent tone and including information that is personal to the readers, he was able to reach his intended audience: those who either aren’t aware of the severity of climate change or those who choose not to acknowledge it. When issues become personal, people begin to care. 
                           <br><br>

The section within the article that was most fascinating to me was Climate Plagues. With my limited understanding of climate change upon entering this class, the prospect of million-year-old  diseases and bugs entering the environment as the Arctic ice that has trapped them melts is frightening. Our immune systems will be useless at fighting off these “new” illnesses and it could be years before medication or vaccinations are discovered to combat them. 
                           <br><br>

I also found Perpetual War to be surprising, yet intriguing altogether. Though it is an out-of-the-box idea (that is, connecting climate change to war), Wallace-Wells makes sense of it. The statistics describing that “for every half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict” shocked me. It opened my eyes to the wide range of effects that climate change has. Climate change is not just an environmental issue. It is a health issue, a safety issue, an economic issue, a political issue, a social justice issue. It is a completely human issue that Wallace-Wells effectively encourages humans to correct. Now, we are in charge of taking this information beyond the screen, beyond our own intelligence, and beginning to take steps toward preventing climate change from devastating our earth even more.

Over the past several months, the climate change issue has entered the global spotlight not only because of activists like Greta Thunberg but also the climate disasters worldwide. Because of all this media coverage, I knew global warming was an alarming problem that needed to be addressed as soon as possible. I did not know how urgent it really was until after I finished reading David Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth”. Every statistic he presented us left me feeling hopeless, especially when he mentioned that credible scientists know places like Bangladesh and Florida will not be around for much longer. The “alarmist” approach the climate change skeptics claim is just to get the public alarmed by presenting exaggerated dangers. Although Well does have an alarmist approach to his article, I believe it is what is necessary to warn people of the severity of global warming. He clearly delivers his arguments and backs it up with evidence by quoting scientists. It may terrify people but we need to begin facing reality.
                           <br><br>

 The breakdown of sections in the article was especially helpful because it can help people who think this pressing issue may not really affect them directly find a connection to it. The heat death caught my attention because my skin is extremely sensitive to the sun. Reading Well’s explanation of the worst possible outcome where human bodies can cook from the inside because of the heat left me terrified. Stepping out in the California sun sometimes has me worried but I can not even imagine that type of direct heat that could lead to millions of deaths worldwide. I began thinking of people, like fieldworkers, who actually work under the sun to harvest the crops that many depend on for food. We will not have enough food if it gets to a point where they can’t do it anymore. My overwhelming thoughts prepared me for reading the third section regarding the end of food and unbreathable air. As I continue reading, in the back of my mind I keep wondering if bringing a child into this world is even right at this point. I would love to take them hiking but now I just see forests constantly on fire. We think that far ahead in our own future but we are not thinking enough about the world we are leaving for them.

David Wallace-Wells does a good job at both concerning and informing his reader, as he needs to do one to develop the other. He makes us realize that no matter how much we talk about climate change or how well informed we are, the dangers of it are inevitable. This is due to the fact that by the majority of us living the way we do, our planet Earth is being destroyed at an alarming yet overlooked rate. We refuse to accept the reality of our actions in hope of our survival but come to realize that ignoring the facts and making little change only worsens what is to come. 
                           <br><br>


Much of what I read in this article intrigued me, but most importantly, I now understand many concepts that have been brought up in a context I previously did not think about. For example, suggestions of colonizing another planet seemed interesting as achievements for humanity and learning how to live in a home other than on the only one we have ever known. However, as time progresses and safety diminishes, we need another inhabitable place if we want to survive. 
                           <br><br>
I also realized the power that water and oceans have in this planet. Given that open water has always been my answer when asked what my biggest fear is, I now have more reasons to explain my answer. Not only is water deadly, as it serves as a starting point for a lot of natural disasters that are strengthened by climate change, such as hurricanes and tsunamis, it also contains poisonous chemicals that are already killing marine life and can also kill humans and animals if released to the air and atmosphere. Rise in sea levels can not only flood businesses on the coastlines but also displace millions of people, adding to the millions that are already wandering the planet with no permanent home or at least a settlement to stay. 
                           <br><br>


Wallace-Wells should not be deemed an “alarmist” because he is simply expressing what the population needs to know and do. He is the person that we need if we want to learn how to survive. Even though this article worries and scares some of us, we need to be informed on what we can face if we continue to ignore the facts, such as the chain reactions that droughts and heat initiate. 
                           <br><br>
Sarah Rose Grossman and Linda O'Connor take a similar approach by publishing seven facts of the past decade that serve to open up the minds of those in denial of climate change and what we are facing. 
                           <br><br>


However, to make his efforts worth the trouble of collecting this information, collective action needs to be taken. Even if his intentions are positive and hopeful, some people may feel discouraged and small when tackling the biggest problem in our lives. We must all come to the agreement that we have to do something about our planet’s current state and encourage one another to take action.

I personally think that Wallace's article completed its intended purposes to be a wakeup call. I agree that most people only scratch the surface of the issues because I know that I only think of things like ocean levels rising. The shear length of Wallace's article about the possible predicted future shows how he is informed on how warming of the earth by a couple degrees can affect so many different aspects. By stating the possible futures, he is successful in being alertist because he is effectively producing a possible future without any fluff just by being blunt, accurate and imaginative. 
                           <br><br>

I believe this approach of alerting the reader is effective to motivate change. If we are passive and unaware of the PRESENT crisis, Wallace believes we are less likely to do anything about it. For myself, Wallace's article opened my eyes to how for warming can affect our lives. I was most surprised by the fact that the economy would be drastically decreased and that the summer of 2003 that killed a couple thousand in europe will be our normal. It is scary in every possible aspect, and the fear provokes action in order to avoid being wiped out. While I do believe it is good that Wallace is alerting his audience, I am not going to lie, I was overwhelmed. It's so hard to imagine that we have pushed our planet to this point where we as humans may face drastic changes to our society and even the possibility of extinction. I'm glad to have had my eyes open to the possible future we face, so my want and urgency to help  is increased

After putting down the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I felt overwhelmed. The front cover itself with the picture of the human skull fossil was enough to set the tone for the article I was about to read. Each part of the article, Doomsday, Heat Death, The End of Food, and others, directly laid out the dangers of the inevitable if we do not take direct action to prevent climate change. Before the article, I was compelled to take action and was filled with determination to take into consideration the advice that resides within this article. However, as I read, finished, and reflected on the article, I felt extremely overwhelmed and daunted at the task at hand. Each problem outlined in the article seemed so big for an individual like me to tackle. Despite my anxiety and lack of motivation to take action, I believe that I still have to work towards making a difference because being idle will do nothing to prevent the growing issue of the climate crisis. 
                           <br><br>


The feeling of fear I felt after reading this article puts into question whether or not the “alarmist” strategy to compel people to take action is effective. I believe that Wallace-Wells is not too alarmist because he directly points out that these scenarios are not likely to all come true if we begin to take aggressive action to prevent them. However, I believe that he is taking a risk in listing out 10 different types of dreadful scenarios that would make even the toughest individual worry a little bit for the future of our planet. I can understand how certain readers who lack a personal connection with the detriments of climate change can be incapacitated by fear. These people will imagine the worst because they have never experienced the effects of climate change or fail to see the effects of climate change in their luxurious lifestyles.  So in some ways, the alarmist approach is a risk because it is capable of causing people to push the problem aside, believing that it is too big of a problem to fix and that it is “inevitable.” However, raising the problems in the alarmist approach is effective in getting the message out and is a valiant effort to rally the people and awaken them to take action. 

                           <br><br>

The scenario that compelled me the most was “Unbreathable Air.” I grew up in Northern California and was very close to the wildfires that occurred two years ago. During the wildfires, my entire neighborhood was engulfed in ash and smoke for a few weeks. I remember checking my phone every day to look at the air quality index online to see if the air in my area was no longer hazardous. Therefore, the quote in the article “By 2050, according to the U.S. Forest Service, wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today; in some places, the area burned could grow fivefold,” is a scary thought and one that I could totally see happening in the future if we do not take immediate action. This part of the article also made me think about the deadly wildfires happening in Australia and its devastating effects on the air, people, and wildlife. It is certainly a prominent example of how climate change is looming right over our heads.

I totally agree with your overwhelming feeling. These catastrophic events seem inevitable in Wells' view and despite his more alarmist approach, his conclusions make sense in the route that we are going. I too also experienced the Thomas Fire a couple of years ago and could not handle the ashy air. It is definitely not what I would want for me or the future generation to experience again.

I am not surprised that David Wallace-Wells' "The Uninhabitable Earth" incited so much controversy. His alarmist approach is enough to make casual readers recoil from the intensity, and I can see how the article has the potential to incapacitate us instead of calling us to act. I empathize and understand his frustration with current information on the state of the climate, however. Abstract and large numbers on top of under-reporting the more grim elements all only serve to contribute to the uncertainty of the planet's future and does not particularly push the public toward serious change. A "wake up call" of sorts is necessary at this point so that people can understand how dire the situation truly is. I enjoyed Wallace-Wells' article. In particular, the first section titled "Doomsday" was interesting to me. I've had only a vague understanding of the term "permafrost", but this reading made me realize the seriousness of the situation. Permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists because it was supposed to be soil that stayed permanently frozen. Knowing this, the fact that is it melting is, in and of itself a terrifying reality. The implications of melting permafrost is equally alarming: the 1.8 trillion tons of carbon trapped in the Arctic can escape and exacerbate the effects that anthropogenic carbon is currently speeding up. I think the most compelling argument from the article is that we need to remove the filter that convinces many into thinking that our individual actions have no serious negative consequences on Earth.

Many would label Wallace-Wells an alarmist or a pessimist, while these allegations are true to some extent, at the end of the century we will be facing a major extinction event; if we do  not alter our current course this will become an indisputable fact. However, where I disagree with Wallace-Wells is that we as a species will eventually do something. The tragedy of climate change is made worse because of its slow moving nature. When one looks at the melting permafrost in the arctic there is: “twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over”(Wallace-Wells). As more methane is released into the atmosphere this will melt more permafrost leading to a positive feedback loop that will produce more and more greenhouse gasses. This is in addition to the increasing production yields of CO2 In the face of these mounting problems there is no evidence of our government attempting to mitigate the damages of climate change. Because of this I denounce Wallace-Wells argument for the removal of the technocrats, like Musk from the solution.

                           <br><br>

 At the end of the day we have to objectively look at the situation of the world right now. Every year CO2 production increases, and massive natural disasters devastate huge portions of the world, and governments across the world have made no meaningful steps to solve the underlying issue of climate change. We cannot rely on our governments to legislate victory but rather our entrepreneurs to innovate our salvation.

When reading the article by David Wallace-Wells you can't help but be a scared of the almost certain future now of what the earth will be like if we don't drastically change our ways of living now. Honestly, after reading the article I was left with almost a sense of panic and this feeling of helplessness. Although, I understand that this article does provide an extremist view point on what will be the impacts of climate change at the end of this century, I believe it still works to show the urgency and importance of the climate crisis today. Sometimes the only way people respond and act is when it is already happening instead of taking precautions and not letting occur in the first place. We are now of course way past the precautionary stage and we are in the stage where we try to save ourselves from this climate apocalypse as David mentions in the article. 
                           <br><br>

Every time I read articles such as these and or videos on the catastrophic impacts of climate change I'm left feeling as though "what can I do to help or can I even help". We constantly hear and see on social media and Tv the devastating impacts of climate change but not regularly do we hear of ways in which we can drastically help stop those giant emissions of carbon into the air. How can I start a movement to find alternative ways to air travel because "Every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London... costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice" as stated by Wallace. These are hards things to think about when thinking of how "I" can help stop the drastic accelerating of climate change. I feel that Wallace took this very "alarmist" approach to help the world comprehend that we need to act now in order to save our future generations of enduring an inhabitable planet.

In the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, Wells is persuading his readers that climate change is a problem, and a serious one. Not only does he state that climate change is an issue, but he also addresses many aspects that will be impacted if the climate is to worsen. The portion of the article that I found most interesting and persuasive was the portion where Wells talks about diseases and how they are impacted by climate change. I found this portion very interesting because I did not know that the virus Zika, or any virus came from climate change. I found this very interesting because I knew that Zika was a very serious and deadly virus but I never questioner where it may have came from. Even when this virus was starting to increase rapidly, I don't recall the news mentioning that it was increasing due to climate change. I found this portion very persuasive because Wells gives actual statistics on how climate change will increase the number of virus carrying insects which will make a virus spread at a more rapid rate. I have never thought of either of these facts before reading this article.
                           <br><br>

This article helped introduce me to new aspects that will affect our lives if the climate worsens. Before taking this course and ENGL 22 I did not recognize the severity of this problem and the fact that we do not have that much time to fix it. Even when I watch the news and climate change is being discussed, there is not a lot of description of what is going on and the urgency of the situation is not communicated. Well's article helps point out that if we are not going to do anything about climate change than people will die. His article brings realization to his audience, especially when he mentions how we can continue putting this issue off, but one day we are going to do something about it and it is going to be too late. This comment conveys a sense of urgency towards the audience and makes those who have not contributed to preventing climate change feel guilt because they are contributing to the problem. I know of a lot of people who feel that them making one minor change in their life to prevent climate change will not make a substantial difference, but if enough people make that change then it will.

After reading "The Uninhabitable Earth," by David Wallace-Wells, the point that astounded me the most was his comparison of the climate crisis to that of the 9/11 attacks and the falling of the Berlin Wall. Both the falling of the Berlin Wall and the twin towers were very notable and tangible events for the general public to observe and in turn respond to. Consequently, the issues such as rapid greenhouse gas emission and the melting of the ice caps are issues that fail to directly affect the lives of the general public at the moment, which is precisely why the climate crisis fails to receive the same type of urgent response that past historical events were given. I believe that it is simply a part of human nature to ignore issues that do not directly hinder one's daily life. This fact alone is what makes preventing future climate devastation such a difficult task. 

                           <br><br>

Although Wallace-Wells describes many of the awful things that can and will likely occur on the planet, he fails to offer up any real solutions. In my opinion, this tactic does not seem that productive because it only instigates fear without promoting hope and actual actions that people can do in order to play a part in slowing down the global temperature. Admittedly, his alarming examples of what the future might hold are necessary I think in order to force people to consider the harsh realities of climate change, however I just think that his negative examples should be accompanied by some ideas of solution as well. Without including example of efforts to reduce climate change, I find the reading to have a rather defeated tone and don't offer much help to the people who want to try and change their lifestyles for the benefit of our planet. It is only in the end of the article that Wallace-Wells praises the ingenuity of the human race as a last hope for humans in the midst of this climate caused catastrophe, where I think he could have definitely conjured up a more inspiring call- to - action for the everyday person, especially following his dark vision of the future.

After just the first section of the article, I am feeling more disappointed and discouraged than before. This may be from hearing lots of goals we are trying to meet are unlikely to be met, such as staying under the two degree limit and saving our coastal regions, or it may be because David Wallace-Wells just bluntly states that our planet is doomed. It clearly is the intention of the writer to scare us into caring, but initially for me, it scared me into losing hope instead of encouraging me to act. 
                           <br><br>

Whether it is a good or bad method, Wallace-Wells is successful in explaining and proving our earth is nearly “doomed”. He is effective in calling attention to this crisis by giving specific examples of the negative repercussions we face from climate change. In certain places, the heat will rise so much making it unbearable without air conditioning, but air conditioning is a major contributor to emissions into the atmosphere, thus creating an example of a lose-lose situation. The global population is constantly increasing while food supply is decreasing, which will eventually result in a food crisis.The extreme heat will not only cause drought and food loss but also cause diseases such as malaria to thrive and pollution to transform the air to be unbreathable. We see today in Australia too the devastation caused by wildfires due to excessive warming, and though this article is two years old, it is more prevalent today as ever.
                           <br><br>

The article says that many climate change researchers believe that “no amount of emissions reduction alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster,” so is there any point in changing lifestyles and devoting so much time to research ways to save our planet? Obviously the negative tone and approach to this article was not to discourage the public from taking action, but is that what it does in reality? To answer my own question, after getting through the entire article, I do not feel as discouraged as I did initially. It ends on a more positive note saying that although we created our own “doomsday” we can also create our way out and I believe that. Once more people acknowledge and understand the climate crisis we are facing, I have hope that although some climate change effects are irreversible, we will be able to prevent more damage and create a more sustainable and liveable home for all of us on earth.

This is the very first article for this class I had to read and I’m very upset and discouraged. I appreciate what Wallace Wells is doing by trying to alarm people about the climate crisis and the seven deadly ways humanity will die, but I personally sort of feel helpless. Wells argues provides many different sources all saying how Earth is going to die from either: “Doomsday”, Heat Death, The End of Food, Climate Plagues, Unbreathable Air, Perpetual War, Permanent Economic Collapse, Poisoned Oceans, and “The Great Filter”. All seven of these situations are inevitable if we don’t act fast and this terrifies me. So many people in our country believe that Climate Change is a hoax and isn’t a threat to our lives. The current administration is currently only making things worse because they are run by fossil fuel billionaires. I’m so angry; I feel like no one is listening and there isn’t really hope because the people in power aren’t doing anything about it.  I want to do something! I want to change my future but I feel like our society is so dependent on capitalism, our leaders will not listen and will continue to kill us. So yes, I think Wells is too alarmist and pessimistic about the future. This is only because he doesn’t provide any solutions to the problem. He says that we need to cut carbon emissions by changing our diet, but doesn’t provide a ways and means to do so. He also says to not have hope in improvements in technology in saving us, and to not rely on carbon capture. 
                            <br><br>

 The prediction that compels me the most is that the poisoning of the oceans. This is in the past hydrogen sulfide is what killed 97% of all life on earth and it took millions of years for the oceans to become habitable again. This scares me because we depend so much on the ocean for our daily lives. The ocean is my favorite place to be and this vital part of our world is constantly being polluted; it makes me so sad .

Having taken an environmental studies course and learning about climate change in science classes prior to this one, I felt I had a fairly good understanding of what climate change is and what would happen is we did not take the action needed to combat it. However, after reading David Wallace-Wells’ article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” I was surprised to find how little I knew about the full extent to which climate change could affect our planet. I definitely felt some degree of fear for our future, especially because the majority of people do not seem to grasp the gravity of taking action to fight climate change now. 
                            <br><br>


The part of Wallace-Wells’ article that stood out to me the most was the section on climate plagues and the paradox on other intelligent life in the universe. The fact that there exists diseases that our immune systems would be unable to fight because they have been trapped in ice for millions of years alone is frightening, but the fact that those diseases could soon be released if we continue on our current path is beyond terrifying. I also found it interesting that global warming is a very feasible answer to the question of why we have yet to encounter other intelligent life in the universe. I found myself thinking: “What if we were just one of hundreds of civilizations that have existed but repeatedly died off due to climate change? And if so, how successful were the civilizations before us? Are we just making the same mistakes over and over, or are we getting any better at fighting climate change?”

                            <br><br>

Despite illustrating in great detail the effects of global warming, I did not exactly feel prompted to action, but rather only deeply worried for the future. Wallace-Wells tells us what will happen if we do not change the way we eat, travel, and live, among other things, but does not provide readers with the ways they can act on it. I believe we need to start with small changes in our daily lives that, as a whole, creates a large impact, but after the article, I still have no idea where to start.
                            <br><br>


As for the “alarmist approach” to climate change, I feel that it really depends on the reader what kind of effect it has. For some, this article will probably scare readers to the point that they will feel the need to take action, but for others, the future Wallace-Wells describes could seem a little too exaggerated.  Although he takes an alarmist approach, I would not label Wallace-Wells as an alarmist. His points are completely valid and well-researched, and using the alarmist tack seems to be the only way to get the world’s attention if we want to make change.

In his article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” David Wallace-Wells takes a very aggressive approach in order to inform his audience of the many dangers that we will continue to face if we fail to refine the ways in which we live. Wallace-Wells addresses a few issues that I have never heard of before, including climate plagues and how time is a key contributor to global warming.

                            <br><br>

The article serves as a massive wake-up call for many individuals, including myself, and it is stated in the text that climate change is occurring at an unimaginable rate. Since we are living in a new age of technological and scientific awakening in regards to exploring the climate crisis, it is difficult to forget how dire the climate change issue is; however, its severity is invariably overlooked.
                            <br><br>


Since this is such a pressing issue, I do not believe that Wallace-Wells is in any way an alarmist. In order to better the state of our Earth, as well as prevent further damage to our ecosystem, it is important for the masses to take action. Perhaps making such an assertive proposal will encourage more people to reconsider their daily choices, regardless of how impactful that may be.

It's funny you use the term "aggressive approach" when describing Wallace Well's technique in conveying his message to the reader because that's precisely how I felt. As a casual reader myself, reading the article felt like a spew of doomsday gloom being shot at me. Of course there were topics i had heard of before (such as ocean poisoning and unbreathable air), but there were other topics that just brought upon this feeling of failure and hopelessness as a species. By the conclusion of the article, I could truly feel Wells trying to bring back this air of hope and belief in the human spirit; still, I found my self with much more of a "how can I do anything" type of feeling at the end. 
                            <br><br>

Looking back at the steps our world has taking, its almost painful to see how overlooked as an issue Climate Change is to both society, and society's leaders. Humans, in all our might, have outright elected to, for the most part, stand by as problems and injustices buildup around us. One such problem that was brought up in the article that I found resonated with me the most was "The End of Food" section. The staggering number that even in our technologically advanced age, we still find over 800 million malnourished people today with another 20 million expected to die off this year. It's perplexing to me that with a more immediate problem such as world hunger, not much is being done to become better. It raises the question: how can we possibly come together to mitigate an even greater tragedy looming in our future?
                            <br><br>

 I agree whole heartedly on your take on Wallace-Wells. Even with my more somber take on his article, I disagree with the idea that Wallace-Wells seeks to scare the public into action. We live in a world where education and combating ignorance pertaining to controversial topics is of the utmost importance. With this in mind, Wallace-wells is more-so an educator of what is to come if we stay along the current course of action. Yes, it's easy to get bogged down by the darkness that the truths bring, but becoming educated on the problem and it's effects is the first step in the right direction.
<br><hr>
I also noticed that David Wallace-Wells was a bit aggressive with his arguments for what could happen on our Earth due to climate change. I think that if he wanted his arguments to cause a sense of desperation in his reader, he definitely succeeded. I too was very impacted by some of the scenarios that he introduced in his article, especially the fact that the melting ice caps could release serious diseases that could decimate the human population, such as the bubonic plague.
                            <br><br>

I feel that, because climate change is constantly being talked about statistically, we as a society have become desensitized to it and all of the events that it has been causing. Many of these events are told to us with embedded statistics, so that (let’s say, 1,000 people died because of a flood) our brains fixate on the 1,000 and we think to ourselves, “Oh wow, that’s a large number. How sad.” And we move on with our lives. But if we were instead told the personal story of one or a few people who were killed, perhaps we may have a more emotional reaction to these sort of events and it may evoke in us a more “green attitude” (meaning that we would be more concerned with how our actions and behaviors affect climate change).
                            <br><br>

In my opinion, Wallace-Wells is not an alarmist. Although I felt a bit depressed after reading his article, I mostly felt that his article is a necessary wake-up call for the masses who simply aren’t doing enough to change their consumer-oriented lifestyles. I also feel that, because he brought up so many different events which could occur due to climate change, it was a very accessible article for people who have many different interests, backgrounds, and perspectives.
<br><hr>

 I agree I think we see tragedy on the news about a flood, fire and other natural disasters, but because we do not experience it first hand we quickly dismiss it and continue on with our everyday lives. We do not stop to consider if we could do anything, or what could have possibly lead up to such an event unfolding. I was not aware that climate change was making tsunamis worse and or increased largely the amount of wild fires. I think it's important to inform people of this information because maybe then they would considering taking action.

After taking English 22 I felt as though I had a deep understanding of climate change and the ways that the increasing temperature affected life on earth, however "The Uninhabitable Earth" brought about a new perspective about not only the environmental consequences but the social and cultural changes associated with the climate crisis. Similar to films watched in the previous course, this article presented the reality of the climate crisis in a devastating way which in a sense comes off in a pessimistic manner due to the fact it creates the idea of a dystopian form of life after the eventual and seemingly irreversiable increase of global temperatures. As a result, I felt quite overwhelmed while reading this because as an individual there isn't much impact I can have with the fossil fuel industry, meat industry and fast fashion industries still functioning as if the environment wasn't at a huge detriment by their mere existence. On another note, I believe the fact that David Wallace- Wells presented his evidence in an alarmist manner is important because there needs to be a sense of urgency for the public to stand up for the environment against the greedy capitalist corporations.

Before reading David Wallace-Well's "Uninhabitable Earth", I thought that it would be another climate change article focusing on how we can change our climate future. To be honest, I never knew  about the issues such as loss of food and climate plagues, and poisoned oceans due to climate change. I never knew that just a 2 degree rise in temperature could send catastrophic consequences throughout the world. To me, that just sounds incredibly terrifying. 
                            <br><br>

Wallace-Well's article opened my eyes to this shocking truth about climate change. He made me feel terrified for our world's future by bringing into attention all the consequences of climate change. His article section on "Poisoned Oceans" personally scares me the most. The detrimental impact of humans emitting greenhouse gases will not only affect humans ourselves, but also all life in the planet. Many people focus on how climate change will impact us individually. However, the greater problem that we should focus on is how climate change will destroy all ecosystems and wildlife that we depend on to survive.

I believe that Wallace-Well's approach to addressing climate change effectively educates his readers of the severity of the issue and compels us to take immediate action. The evidence that he provides for each of his article sections force us to imagine a uninhabitable future with these consequences. Wallace-Well makes me think about the consequences of my own actions. I believe that Wallace-Well's alarmist tone is exactly what we need to understand the reality we are facing. We should feel fear about climate change because it is fear that will ultimately incite us to change our individual actions.

Similarly reading David Wallace-Well's "Uninhabitable Earth" gave me further insight into what the climate crisis entails. Specifically, the section about climate plagues and permafrost was educating to me, for example, that Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon. I think that it is important to be educated on all different areas of the climate crisis in order to understand the severity of the issue fully. A good amount of people just think that icebergs are melting. I really liked the line "But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial, too". It made me wish that he actually went into more detail about what people can do in terms of action because that is something I believe people can be constantly reminded of. I think it could really detract from the hopelessness of the situation and reinstate the power we hold as individuals in the economy and political systems, but also as an advanced country. 
                            <br><br>

I agree Wallace-Well's tone of emergency is justified in this situation however, I don't believe it is attractive to people doubting the climate crisis. This leads me to believe that people of doubt are not his intended audience, but rather people who are searching for further information on the topic. With that said, I personally think Wallace-Well's should have withheld from using emotional terminology until later in his essay for this purpose. Ultimately Wallace-Wells does a marvelous job of addressing what is often ignored. I agree that he really forces the reader to consider Earth's future and humanity's future from a broader perspective. Also, I agree that fear is important because it initiates action. I really like your last sentence.

In "The Uninhabitable Earth", David Wallace Wells discusses multiple aspects of climate change's effects that I had not considered. Some of the consequences such as ocean acidification and air pollution I was aware of from high school, but other consequences such as the instability in an economic and political scope that would follow were new to me. In particular, the idea that as temperatures increase, the melting ice is releasing plagues and bacteria that have gone unseen by humanity for, in some cases, its existence, stood out to me. A new plague could move at unprecedented speeds.

His "alarmist" distinction is certainly fitting. While necessary, he conveys the severity of the issues a little too well as my response to the article was one of little optimism. However, it is essential that the severity of our situation is conveyed through his article since I feel the overall awareness of the truth behind our current position is far too low. The fact that our situation continues to worsen by the day is a testament to this. Hopefully this alarmist approach can succeed in creating progressive action.

While David Wallace Wells could rightfully be labeled as an alarmist, his ideas hold a lot of truth. Some might think of him as being “too alarmist”, but often time fear is needed to evoke action. By talking about the possibilities humanity faces as a result of climate change, he brings attention to the issue and shows how big of an impact it will likely have on earth as well as the readers themselves. After reading the article, I did not personally feel any more prompted to action than I have been in the past; I just became more concerned. I think that while small actions can ultimately make a difference, big steps need to be taken to achieve a noticeable change – such as changes in government, economy, and global policies. I do think the alarmist method of creating action is practical, but not without the inclusion of hope for success. Wells mostly describes the downfalls, but not what can happen if we succeed. The section titled “Unbreathable Air” was extremely compelling as clean air is something that many people take for granted. Declining air quality is already causing fatalities across the world and is likely only going to get worse without a change. I do not think Wallace Wells is necessarily looking forward to an uncertain future, rather he is revealing what the future might look like if we continue living without making major changes to our emissions. The last several facts talked about at the end of the video are evidence to Wallace Wells’ claims in the article. If so much disaster has already been seen before the 2 degree Celsius rise in global temperature, it is likely the problems will continue to get worse and worse over the upcoming decades and even the next few years. Wallace Wells brings frightfully real and unwanted results of climate change to the front of the readers’ minds, which hopefully will alert and wake people up to reality.

Reading “Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was very alarming to me and made me realize we as a community have to change the way we live to help our kids and the next generation. Before reading this article I knew climate change was real and bad, but I never realized how bad it actually is and how rapidly it can start to affect our everyday life. He talks about a crack in an ice shelf that has expanded for 11 miles in just 6 days, which will cause sea levels to rise. If this keeps happening sea levels will continue to rise and our coastlines will disappear along with major cities such as Miami. One major thing I learned from the reading that mesmerized me was every return flight from London to New York costs the Arctic three square metres of ice. This is a crazy statistic to me because there are many flights a day from London to New York, which wont stop anytime soon, which means ice will keep melting and sea levels will continue to rise. Also the production of plastic is continuing to rise exponentially in the coming years. Reports say that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. This is terrible for marine life and plastic slows down decomposition which is terrible for the climate. David Wallace-Wells “Uninhabitable earth” made me realize we have to start change now and stop thinking that everything will be solved on its own. Our generation needs to stop being selfish and make sure that the world is in good hands for our kids and the generation after that.

After reading David Wallace-Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth," I realized that the world and humanity are in more trouble than I had first thought. It was an interesting and self-reflecting read after all the facts were laid out. I can see why some people would illustrate Wells as an alarmist as his article definitely creates a sense of danger and fright. Especially since the sections are titled "Doomsday," "End of Food," and "Climate Plague." I see why Wells would want to try and "alarm" people to doing something about this disaster. As a first time reader of his article, I feel that Wells seems aggressive about the issue and it's true that he does want people to realize the consequences of human actions. Perhaps it's due to his passionate concern of the issue and truly wants his audience to gain a feeling of "time is running out" feel. 

                            <br><br>

Even so, Wells pointed out many examples of how climate change is changing in our world and what it is affecting. 
                            <br><br>
I liked how the article was broken up into sections because each section was carefully thought out and made it easier to comprehend the material. One section that intrigued me the most was the "Climate Plague" section as it really opened my eyes to a new perspective I hadn't thought about before. Essentially, we are being plagued by the climate we affected ourselves. Humans are the largest species to contribute toward climate change and now we see the unfortunate effects start to unravel. As Wells talks about the ice and diseases that are trapped, I got a chilling feeling whilst reading. I appreciated this fact because I did not even think about prehistoric times and its effects on the present. 

                            <br><br>

After watching Ken's video, I feel motivated and want to do more on trying to reduce climate change. The 7 facts Ken mentioned at the end of the video was shocking but not surprising. It is so upsetting how we let it get this far and how many people who have the ability to try and reduce climate change i.e. billionaires and millionaires, have the resources to do so but won't. Each fact got worse and worse and made me feel very unsafe on a planet we call home. However, I do feel hopeful knowing that there are others who are trying to spread awareness such as this class.

    I agree with the sentiments and worries expressed in your comment, especially in how Wallace-Wells conveys the importance of the Climate Crisis through many different examples. His audience isn’t just provided with statistics, instead, they are shown the hypothetical consequences of each of these scenarios. Wallace-Wells relies on each of these scenarios to express the many consequences of the climate crisis.



I also agree with the idea that each of the sections contributed a different understanding to the Climate Crisis, some of which have not been considered by the general public. While I also found the “Climate Plague” section to be interesting, I think that my personal favorite section was the “Perpetual War” section because it seems to become more relevant with each passing day. I felt that this section offered a new and unheard-of perspective on the growing conflict around the world. By suggesting that global warming contributes to the growing conflicts in the Middle East, Wallace-Wells makes the argument for climate change more relevant to a larger audience.


My favorite part of “The Uninhabitable Earth” was that it did not just provide simple facts and logic to persuade its audience of the dangerous effects of climate change. Instead, it provided multiple arguments on its harmful effects, allowing every reader to be convinced by a different argument or section. Its overarching argument was strengthened by each of the individual sections. Wallace-Wells is able to brilliantly connect each of his different points to accurately convey the importance and urgency of climate change. While his reader may have considered parts of his argument, very few are likely to have considered all of the points that he makes in the article.

After Reading David Wallace-Wells article titled “The Uninhabitable Earth” I was more alarmed than ever about what is happening to our planet. But, his article didn’t frighten me into feeling like nothing can change and that we are doomed. I feel like the alarmist approach he took was strong and necessary for this major issue that most people worldwide don’t think about as important enough to change. Although not everyone can agree with everything that Wells argues and states because of their own views and beliefs, I think that he worded his arguments very clearly and this helps the majority of his readers understand this critical issue. The first fact that truly opened my eyes to the horrible situation we have put ourselves in is, “Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe: tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate accords, and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it” (Wells). We have switched from being scared of the 2 degree increase to now hoping we can keep it at that. Hopefully, this is as big of a wake up call for his readers as it was for me because it proves that this situation is not “fake” or not important like many political figures believe. The media also plays a big role in how Americans and people worldwide view this issue because many news sources suppress how dire the climate crisis truly is, which is why many people don’t actually try to make changes in their own lifestyles to help the environment. 
                            <br><br>

The most compelling and scary section of this article for me was “IV. Climate Plagues” because I never thought about how horrible diseases are and have been trapped in ice (in the Arctic for example) for millions of years. With the melting of glaciers and ice worldwide, these diseases can recirculate and cause disastrous and deadly plagues. We are not immune to these diseases because modern humans haven’t had to deal with them which is extremely scary to me. Although many people might see this as an issue that isn’t too horrible because it most likely won’t directly affect us in this century, we must do what we can to help future generations and our Earth so no one has to deal with these horrible events. While reading this article I was thinking about the extreme wildfires happening right now in Australia. As I stated before, the media barely shows what is going on there and how so many people have died and even more animals have died because of these wildfires. Likewise, as Ken stated in the lecture video, 4 out of the 5 largest wildfires in California have occurred in the past decade. Many people don’t attribute wildfires (and other major environmental events) to global warming because they don’t understand the science behind it, but if we educate people from a young age about how dire this situation is, people might have a bigger desire to take action and stop more damage to the Earth.
                            <br><br>

I do believe that we can stop more damage from being done if more people are educated on the topic of climate change and see the importance of fighting for our Earth. People need to fight for generations and generations of people to be able to live in a healthy and safe environment rather than be selfish. This article serves as a wake up call for all its readers and should be taken as one. Although some parts are scary and seem unimaginable, this approach is the strongest way to get people to want to make changes in their lives to better the Earth.

I really liked your response! As someone who has taken two courses on UCSB that covered climate change, one called “global warming” and one called “environmental ethics” (both great classes by the way!), I felt I was pretty well informed on what climate change could do to our Earth. And this article blew my socks off. I had a very similar emotional reaction to you, while I was alarmed it didn’t freeze me and cause me to feel helpless, rather I felt that more people need to be informed and this course should be a GE that is required (called Area CC aka CLIMATE CRISS). First of all, the point you made about the two degree celsius rise that Walls mentioned was interesting, but the funny thing is a recent IPCC report (2018) said we must keep the warming to 1.5 degree Celcius and that two degrees was too optimistic. And that 1.5 degree target is nearly impossible and we are approaching it so fast. We are now praying, as you said, to keep the degree warming from pre industrial times to 2 degree C.
                            <br><br>
I liked your section on climate plagues as well. I had no idea this was a thing and I literally when I read from “The Uninhabitable Earth” I got some anxious and uneasy feelings throughout my body.  I think we need to think more about the issues that may happen in the long term (like climate plagues and major sea level rise) as part of an overall reason to declare a state of emergency in the US and around the world and fight climate change. You mention the California Wildfire things, and yes in my global warming class we learned about this and that warmer air (from climate change) actually holds more water vapor. This means that areas already hot and prone to wildfires (due to droughts and lack of precipitation) get hotter, which means even less rain and more droughts. This leads to more and wider spread wildfires. 
                            <br><br>
One thing you didn’t mention that I was shocked by was that the IPCC report doesn’t account for albedo, cloud cover, or the dieback from forests! This means that each IPCC report no matter how dense and well researched is always technically a bit optimistic! This means that whenever sea ice melts, they can’t account for the loss of reflectivity from the white ice and the addition of more dark absorptive ocean water,  which I was shocked by. 
                            <br><br>
I totally agree with your last point. Education is key. If everyone was educated about this from high school or college this issue would be so much smaller than it is today. It is a really sad fact that this is not common knowledge considering the catastrophic global damage and havoc it will cause. And the saddest part is the injustice of it: the poorer areas will be affected the most and they are not even the ones who contributed to the majority of the climate crisis through greenhouse emissions! The wealthy countries like the US and China and Europe did! Overall, I thought your response was very interesting Lian!

From my primary school period, I always know that the earth is in danger, and human beings must take actions to save the earth. I never really understand the severity of climate change because everything I know is from the cold data, which, as a teen, I could hardly understand the staggering fact lied right outside the doors and under the cold data. The sad thing is whatever we do now, even stop the whole fossil fuel or oil industry, we can not offset or even stop the damage people had made ever since the industrial revolution. We do have the Paris Agreement, but nations only agree on trying their best to slow down the rising of temperature, while in fact, none of them is being monitored or forced, which means the effectiveness of this agreement is still not that strong.

                            <br><br>

The passage is more like a wake up call, dragging people from the fantasy they make up that earth will never be perished and human beings can live on it happily ever after without worrying what human activities might bring to damage the earth. people doing actions today are not for ourselves for we might not be able to witness the changes, we are doing what we should do decades before for people decades later

I also did not understand how severe the issue was until after reading the article. I took an environmental class last year and was assigned a book that taught me how much damage we are causing by simply shopping from stores and it was frightening. I also agree that the article does serve as a way to alert us of what is happening so that we can realize the danger we are in. I did not know the many ways that the earth is damaged.

As the years pass, it is becoming abundantly clear that while the dark, ominous cloud of climate crisis rises right above our heads, there is no sense of forewarning on any type of media platform. David Wallace-Wells' piece "The Uninhabitable Earth" does a good job of putting together all the climate catastrophes the have not received the attention they should have in the last couple decades. Wells' article is incredibly alarming, but this alarm could be said to actually be needed when faced with the impending "doomsday" that Wells' speaks about.
                            <br><br>

Furthermore, I myself have given thought to the issues arriving with climate change but only so briefly that they are gone from my head in the next two minutes. However, Wells' words on how the heat temperatures in areas such as Costa Rica are causing outside labor to be unbearable brought a sense of true fear for the rest of the world's regions. His talk of our hope to reach 2 degrees warming now decreasing brings to question why scientists have made such little issue of this. The fear Wells' article instills is the only thing I believe will truly bring people to act. He poses various situations that can very easily become a reality and situation that have already come to happen such as the Arctic ice shelves splitting and only being 3 miles away from finally falling apart. The sense of his urgency for some may cue him in as an "alarmist" but with every new section I would say that this alarm us rightfully needed. With coral reefs dying out it poses the risk of killing off "as much as a quarter of all marine life" that "[supplies] food for half a billion people". Wells makes it clear that we are at the stage where even any type of improvement can only hope to slow down our Earth's very own "doomsday".

David Wallace Wells' article, "The Uninhabitable Earth" is an undeniably controversial piece detailing potential consequences of our current actions in regard to our climate. Wells' article controversially describes future consequences in an alarmist way. His writing contains significant elements of urgency and fear mongering. However, his rhetoric, while alarmist,  is both purposeful and effective. I take no issues with his rhetoric, however, there is an element of deception in part of his work that leaves me frustrated.  In part IV of Wells’ Article, he at best, misinterprets, and at worst, intentionally deceives the reader by misrepresenting the underlying science. Wells’ heavily implies, if not outright states, that the melting permafrost is causally related to the anthrax outbreak, “But already last year, a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier.” However, this claim ignores much of the nuance in the underlying science. Reading a 2019 scientific article on the anthrax bacteria published in reputed online science database tells me that the anthrax coming from melting permafrost is merely a possibility and not, as Well’s puts it, a guarantee. The article states that “ … given the potentially high preservation of B. anthracis spores in a cold environment, could lead to new outbreaks of the disease.” Furthermore, in Wells’ annotation he both fails to rectify this, as well as cites an article to further support his work. However, the cited article contains the same issues as Wells’ original one. For this reason, I find the rest of the authors claims to be less credible. If I can identify these errors in a part where I am only barely qualified to spot them, how many more such errors does this article contain?

On a less critical note, I found the section of his article on the relationship between violence and heat was very interesting. I had actually been wondering the same thing myself for a very long. Ever since reading Romeo and Juliet in 8th grade Drama, I had always been curious about heat and anger. Specifically a line by Benvolio triggered my curiosity. "The day is hot; the Capulets, abroad; And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl, For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring." Since that day I had that concept of violence being related to heat stored in the back of my head. I kept seeing that relationship reiterated throughout both literature and music. With numerous prominent examples in Hip Hop music. Chance the Rapper's lyrics in his song "Paranoia" "Cause everybody dies in the summer, Wanna say your goodbyes say them in the Spring." in reference to gang violence epitomize to me this relationship of heat and violence. I'm glad to see this trend observed and described by someone else.

I found the points made in your comment to be incredibly perceptive and equally as thought provoking. Your criticism of Wallace Wells' selective rhetoric outlines a tremendous problem in climate change rhetoric in general; that is, in an effort to reach ones audience, most experts (and many far less qualified authors) utilize an alarmist approach when discussing this topic. As nearly all of our classmates have noted, this method can be very effective when those exposed to it are susceptible to the graphic imagery of such a horror story as the one Wallace Wells has conveyed. It can elicit a great sense of urgency in the minds of the consumer and serve as an effective call to action or, at the very least, evoke an episode of deep thought on the subject. The trouble with this method, however, is that those who react in this desired manner are not the individuals who need convincing, but rather those who likely already harbor underlying concerns regarding climate change. The purpose of such an article should not be to scare those who already consider climate change a threat (though it is true most who do believe in climate change tend to underestimate its looming consequences), but rather tackle a grander hurdle faced by today's society: those who are skeptic of climate change all together. When a skeptic is faced with jarring and possibly exaggerated figures such as the ones expressed by Wallace Wells, the response is almost always absolute denial. Thus, Wallace Wells shuts down the audience members of chief importance in an effort to prove his point. 
<br><br>

Additionally, your inquisition of the relationship between heat and violence is one which has perplexed me as well. Your pop culture examples derived from "Romeo and Juliet" as well as Chance the Rapper are both familiar to me and incredibly apt. My first encounter with the phenomenon was whilst reading "The Great Gatsby," when tensions between the characters come to fruition on the hottest day of summer. Fitzgerald describes the heat as "oppressive" and "beating" thus foiling the violence taking place among   the characters while also incorporating the archetypal association between heat and violence. I too have always wondered how this sort of situation would manifest itself in the era of climate change. Though whispers of climate change did not begin until nearly 50 years after Fitzgerald authored "The Great Gatsby" and centuries after Shakespeare wrote the final pages of "Romeo and Juliet," these works of literature do provide a faint echo of the fictionalization of the terrors of climate change described by Wallace Wells in section  9 of his article.

<br><hr>
I found your response to be stimulating. I had not considered the issue that climate change deniers could use an opposing view to further entrench their own beliefs. Many people will further reinforce their own beliefs when presented with a radically opposing view. I wonder how then, to convey a proper sense of urgency, without alienating non-believers. Is it worth alienating them and simply further provoking those who believe to action, or would it be better to attempt to get everyone on board? Ideally everyone would understand the urgency with which action is to be taken, but unfortunately real life does not quite work that way. I enjoyed reading your analysis of the relationship between heat and violence, I had not considered the example of the Great Gatsby.

I was very intrigued by David Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth”, the article not only looked at the effect of two degree warming but went all the way up to an eleven degree warming, but also looked at different areas in the world. One thing that has scared me since learning about global warming is where will I live in my future, and how will it look? Will I be able to enjoy outdoor activities or see nature all around the world before it is gone? Will I be able to see beautiful coral while snorkeling? Wallace Wells' article did scare me, but gave me motivation to act and continue changing my lifestyle to more environmentally friendly. His writing was understandable, and I was able to see how passionate he is at educating people about the climate crisis. His article also gave me a larger perspective on mass extinctions, I was raised in a religious household and my views on humanity used to be that we were it (very anthropocentric). I never took in to account that other forms of life were here before us that ended in extinction as well, so why wouldn't we susceptible to that end? I feel that his style of alarmist gives me more reason to take action in the problem. Another prediction that scared me was that old diseases in the ice may come back to affect the world population. This is ironic because every time I am stuck in traffic or somewhere crowded I say "We need a new plague". That would hypothetically help our climate crisis, but is on the unethical side to think about. 
<br><br>

Anytime I think about global warming I relate it to evolution and how we may evolve if we can change the path we're on. At this rate there is no way to evolve to the point of surviving an eleven degree warming. So our only option is to change our habits now and hope it's enough to slow warming to allow us to evolve, or stop warming all together. I hope more people see the real problem here, and stop questioning or doubting the climate crisis. No matter how extreme an approach an environmentalist takes, their intentions are to stop climate change and give future generations a shot at good quality of life on Earth.

Before reading David Wallace's article "The Inhabitable Earth" I already felt quite aware of the fact that our Earth was in danger due to climate change. After reading his article, I now realize that it is so much worse than I thought. The article "The Inhabitable Earth" was a huge wake up call for me. I agree that Wallace plays the role of an alarmist but for good reason. I also understand how some will look at an article like this and immediately feel scared (some too scared to take action) however, this was not the case for me. Although this article did have a frightening affect on me, it made me want to go out and make a change more than anything. I personally feel as though we need more alarmists like David Wallace to get the rest of the population to open their eyes and recognize that if we do not take action, this Earth will begin to self destruct. 
<br><br>

I liked how Wallace painted this picture of our planet as some sort of "angry beast". I think it is important for more people to start viewing our Earth not as some large, beautiful and gentle planet, but as what it truly is: an angry beast. We have been continuously antagonizing and poking at this beast and how does it respond to this? With wild fires, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and hail. I feel as though our planet is trying to communicate with us. Every time we experience a tragic natural disaster it is the Earth crying for help and the sooner people recognize that the better.  
<br><br>

Throughout the article Wallace brings to the readers attention many alarming things that appear to be in our future. Personally, I found the section about climate plagues to be the most terrifying. Wallace states that there are many ancient diseases that are frozen inside Arctic ice. As our Earth continues to get warmer and warmer more and more ice is going to melt. As this ice melts, all of those diseases will get released into the air and will begin traveling around our globe, infecting Earth's population. These diseases have not been around for millions of years, therefore our bodies will not know how to fight off such illnesses. I think this particular idea scares me the most because all it takes is for one human to catch a disease for it to spread rapidly across a nation which could easily lead to a mass extinction depending on what kind of disease we are dealing with.

It is very worrisome knowing that there is more negative content on climate change than positive. After taking English 22 and having very minimal knowledge on climate change, if not complete ignorance, I have never felt more anxious about an environmental concern. "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace Wells censors nothing regarding the inevitable global temperature increase and I praise him for that. We are in a stage of Earth's deterioration that can not take anymore censorship. People need to become aware of the terrifying reality we are facing through climate change. That being said, I don't understand how there are still people who refuse to accept the reality of climate change-especially Americans. Prior to reading this article, I can easily say I was one of those ignorant individuals. I was aware of climate change but never accepted it because I did not understand it. I did not understand the seriousness of a 2 degree global temperature increase because 2 just sounds like such a small number. David Wallace Wells shows how consequences of climate change are already taking place as well as future conflicts we are likely to experience.

The captivating article The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells effectively terrifies its audience with the dooming fate of climate change. Wallace makes it a point to inform his readers of the severity of our current climate crisis. The reality of rising seas, global warming, and effects so detrimental our planet will be uninhabitable. While each section of this article is just as fascinating as the next, the section of the article I find most fascinating were the striking facts of permafrost. With twice as much carbon trapped in permafrost than we currently have in the atmosphere the level of devastation would be unheard of. 

<br><br>

Moreover, the thought that the dystopias we watch on movie screens or read about in books could be approaching reality is terrifying. In addition, the present tense of climate change threatens the existence of large cities like Miami and Bangladesh shows this article is not like every other. While the seemingly aggressive wake-up call numbers listed throughout may be frightening they also prove to be effective. As an example myself, this article has enlightened me to be further conscious of our planet's current climate state. In light of recent and current events I find this article, as it may seem harsh, just what everyone needs. The truth of climate change is not going anywhere so why sugar coat it? 

<br><br>

Wallace may be labeled as an alarmist but I must say, where is the line drawn between alarming and passionate? He makes valid points with factual evidence and credible research. I find Wallace’s activism inspiring.

In the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, he takes some examples of what would occur if humans continue to destroy Earth and the environment. In the article, he lists multiple possible outcomes, such as food shortage, rising sea level, climate plague, perpetual war, and unbreathable air. After reading the article, I think I get prompted and realize that I underestimated the level of dangerous climate change can have on Earth. Even though many people call the author an alarmist, it is better to take environmental issues seriously and considerably in my mind. His statements seem startling for us, but the truth is that our environment is getting worse. 
 <br><br>

As Wells mentions, researchers say that Miami and Bangladesh will disappear within the century. He says 2019 is the hottest year ever recorded on the planet. This extreme temperature has resulted in many unusual phenomena. It reminds me of Venice, a disappearing city. In 2019, Venice experienced the worstflood, which was above sea level since 1966. The increase in flooding in Venice is due to the combined effects of land subsidence causing the city to sink and climate change causing the global sea level to rise. Though Venice floods periodically, but the degree of flooding is increasing due to the rise of sea level. Therefore, instead of fleeing the coastline, humans should take action before disasters appear because it is not just shocking statements to attract attention. 
 <br><br>

Out of all the examples and statements Wells mentioned in his article, I think the one related to unbreathable air is the most compelling one. Nowadays, air pollution is a hot topic that people concern with daily. It refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. According to Wells, most air pollution comes from energy use and production. Researchers say, “About 10,000 people die each day due to particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning.” Smog can irritate the eyes and throat and also damage the lungs, especially for those who work outside. It reminds me the wildfire in Australia. Recently, Australia’s capital, Canberra, has been blanketed by a thick haze of smoke from nearby fires. Southeastern Australia is experiencing one of the worst fire seasons on record. Though reasons may vary, climate change should be one of those that cause a fierce fire. The pollutants released from wildfires harm the health of residents and firefighters and millions of animals and plants died due to fire and smog. Therefore, Wells’ statements are convincing. With the increase of toxic particles and pollutants in the air, humans may be no longer breath and the result is unimaginable.

Reading “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was eye-opening to me. I had previously only considered greenhouses gases as a major cause of climate change, with rising sea levels as the main effect. I do not believe Wallace-Wells is too alarmist in his approach because society needs this wake up call. Even the President of the United States fails to recognize the utter fate of our Earth if action is not taken soon. Despite climate change being a proven fact, many choose to associate it as a political standpoint. With that being said, there is a risk of losing readers just due to the subject matter. Therefore, those who choose to read this article through and through most likely already “believe” in climate change and Wallace-Wells’ alarmist approach would create a call-to-action.
 <br><br>


After reading this article, the first thing I wanted to do was cancel my online order from Urban Outfitters and my second impulse was to share Wallace-Wells’ findings with my friends and family. I have been a vegetarian for thirteen years. This choice was due to my love of animals at a young age and with that still being the case, I later became aware of the negative impact of factory farming on the environment. In almost every family debate in retaliation to my refusal to consume murdered animals I bring up how disastrous cows’ methane farts are to the planet, causing me to resonate with Wallace-Wells’ “The End of Food” section. Yet, the most surprising part to me was under the “Climate Plagues” section, where Wallace-Wells explained how diseases that have not circulated the air for millions of years are trapped in Arctic Ice. I never considered all the effects a rising temperature had for our habitat and have a mixed feeling of emotions after reading this article: glad that I am no longer oblivious to where the planet’s future is headed and terrified.

Society definitely needs a wake-up call when it comes to environmental consciousness and if anything I don’t think the problem is Wallace-Well’s “alarmist” approach, but it’s those who feel that he is an alarmist. I like that you put “believe” in quotations because, in actuality, climate change just is, it’s not something to believe in or not, but I digress. This article may risk going over the heads of those who do not “believe” in climate change because they may just brush it off as another climate article, but that being said, it could actually be more beneficial to those who are already aware of climate change. New information that some of us didn’t know about can help to fuel a fire that we already have in regard to climate activism. Like you, there were a few facts in this article that I was unaware of like how a human body would be cooked inside and out in Costa Rica at 7 degrees of warming. Instances like these just remind us that we can continue to learn about how the climate crisis is evolving and different outcomes of the crisis.


<br><hr>
I agree with your points made. Stating “I don’t think the problem is Wallace-Well’s “alarmist” approach, but it’s those who feel that he is an alarmist” makes a lot of sense and puts in perspective how binary this issue is. Turning climate change into two extremes (skeptics v. alarmists) hinders the ability for change to be created. The wellbeing of our environment being turned into a political issue, when it should be regarded as a matter of life and death, only adds to this problem. I appreciate your point of view about how although “non-believers” may be scared away by this article, those who do “believe” in climate change might be motivated to make drastic changes.

Wallace-Wells’ article depicts our current climate crisis as nothing less than it is: apocalyptic. He provides many predictions for what the world may look like within our lifetime as the planet grows warmer—some of which have even already occurred in the past two years since it’s been written. 
 <br><br>

Many of the statistics considered in his piece are shocking. The climate crisis goes so far beyond just the obvious derivatives of warmer temperatures and sea level rise; it will have a profound impact on weather and climate, but also on the amount of armed conflict and our economic health and the habitability of our planet and our refugee crises and so much more. With the climate already having warmed one degree, we've already seen the impacts of this, and it is only going to get worse. It's frustrating considering reasons why there has been such a lack of action--such as economic growth--when the truth of the matter is simply that none of it will matter by the end of our lifetime when we've reached economic collapse, and the collapse of everything else that's a result of climate change if we don't tackle the problem.
 <br><br>

He doesn’t sugarcoat. It’s almost difficult not to fall into nihilism while reading this; questions such as 'will it be fixable?' and 'does life simply have a time stamp on it?' are provoked with a topic so somber. However, it's vitally important to not dismiss his piece, or others of its kind, for being too alarmist. That which is presented here is simply the reality of the situation: it's lethal, it's urgent, and it's inevitable if we do not take action.

Wallace-Wells is an alarmist, but he is not too extreme. Only by depicting the future using current events will the consequences seem real. Cold statistics do not create the same impact as it is abstract and hard to sense. Moreover, he was being realistic; we are not on the path to meeting the COP21 agreement, and countries are already withdrawing. It is important to know where we are headed, if not to less than 2 degrees celsius. I was not paralyzed by fear or hopeless after reading this article because those things don’t help solve anything. If it seems to large an issue, take small actions. By the end of the article, after being inundated with bad news, I was tired of it and was looking for solutions, so yes. This article prompted me to action. I don’t think it should paralyze anyone or leave them hopeless. It may however alienate people who are not very persistent. They may feel overwhelmed and choose the lazy way out: stick their head in the sand or cry instead of moving and doing something about it. Yes, you can grieve, but do something about it.

 <br><br>

Although his descriptions seem apocalyptic and something of science fiction, Wallace-Wells pairs them with current situations to show that drastic change could occur in the near future. By painting a portrait of our current situation and showing how little time it took to get here, Wallace-Wells supports his projections of the future and make the issue more urgent. Although he begins with detached statistics, he connects these numbers to human impact and creates emotional relevance, creating more alarm. The climate is not just getting warmer in some areas, it is getting so warm that people are dying. It’s not just “people dying” either; he illustrates how they die and how many died. Take for instance, the ½ sugarcane workers that are dying of kidney disease from the heat in El Salvador, a region that was tolerable only two decades ago. Using this example as support, he paints the image of what will happen with a 7 degree warming: the “human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out.” With present examples and lurid descriptions of the future, Wallace-Wells instills terror into his readers.
 <br><br>

Out of the consequences discussed in the article, unbreathable air took the cake for me. As someone who has experienced 270 AQI from forest fires, I strongly empathize with the unbreathable air section. There is no freedom: I couldn’t go outside much, was physically limited and could not run. Air is crucial, and breathing is my anchor in times of distress. If I don’t even have good air, what do I have? I feel bad for the people in China that had to face over 800 Air Quality Index. There is no freedom, and a scene from a documentary comes to mind: an unused playground cloaked by smog. The children don’t play outside. The windows remain shut; there is no “breath of fresh air,” only indoors air saturated with carbon dioxide and toxic pollutants. I am lucky to be living in Santa Barbara, where there is good air thanks to the beach, and this section reminded me that this is not the case in most places. If you can’t run, can’t move, can’t go outside, if you are trapped indoors, are you really living? Quality of life significantly decreases with poor air. Before it gets to the unbreathable stage, we will have faced increased carbon dioxide concentration which lowers our mental abilities. I already feel lethargic in a stuffy room. At least I get to go outside and get fresh air. Pretty soon, I won’t be able to, and this is very alarming.

I believe many of Wallace’s points are very valid, and that everyone should be aware of what is going on in the world. However, this may not have been the best approach to getting people to take action. While most people are aware that climate change is a very real thing, some do not believe that it is happening and may take a step back at such an extreme stance. Those who are aware of the reality of climate change, on the other hand, would probably take this article very seriously and will want to take action to help stop climate change. Personally, after reading this article, I felt a sense of doom that the article was trying to convey. Wallace had presented many different points, some that I had not even thought of. I felt like I wanted to be able to do something about it, but I also did not really know what I could do. I think if he wanted to prompt people to take action, a better approach would be to state what people could do to help the planet. Instead of focusing on just what would happen to the earth, it would be better to also focus on people who are already making a change and how people could start making a change. It would make the situation seem more hopeful and would inspire people to take action much more effectively.
  <br><br>
Out of Wallace’s many points, I thought his view on climate change affecting the economy and war was the most interesting. I never really viewed climate change as something that could affect the economy and war that much, but after reading the article, the connection is much more clear. Before reading the article, I was not aware of the correlation between temperature and crime rates. It surprised me to see that climate change could potentially affect how violent people act and increase the probability of war occurring. While I could see climate change affecting the economy, this article drew it out much more clearly for me. I could imagine exactly how and what would happen to the economy if climate change took its course. These two were the most surprising of Wallace’s points to me, as they were not consequences I immediately thought of when hearing about climate change.

Prior to reading this article, I already had a sense that I was about to learn that climate change was so much worse in severity than the offhand way its discussed in the media but I honestly was not prepared to learn just how bad it has become in the recent years.  I find that I was greatly misinformed and unaware about several problems that global warming poses to life on Earth, such as when I read the section in Well's article about the melting of permafrost. I had zero clue that the process of carbon dioxide releasing from melting permafrost that threatens us today was something that had caused several mass extinction events in the past so reading that made my heart sink. It's mind-boggling to think that a large majority of life on this planet could be wiped out due to careless repetition of history and definitely not something I had considered. In addition to that, I also had no clue about the fact that this melting of ice could potentially unleash a myriad of deadly pathogens and diseases that have been dormant for several years, causing a potential pandemic that would kill us faster than climate change itself. These facts along with the other points mentioned in the article really opened my eyes about just how deeply rooted this problem of global warming is.
  <br><br>


Honestly, I'm glad that Wells uses an alarmist approach to discuss this matter because the topic of climate change is certainly something we should not be tiptoeing around in such a dire situation as the one we are in. This event poses a potential risk to life as we know it here on our planet and yet a vast majority of us doesn't seem to be perturbed in the slightest about our possible demise, save for few individuals I've seen in the media such as Greta Thunberg and others rallying for awareness. We even have people outright denying the facts and science layed out in favor of their own monetary gain, which is sad because these people hold influential positions and could just as easily reverse the problem if they only put aside their greed. Their words spread misinformation and falsely placate uneducated people in a time where it is crucial that everyone knows the truth about what's going on with our planet. 
  <br><br>

What this article did for me personally is make me realize that I don't want to live in a dystopian future where we war in a planet that has been ravaged by the effects of climate change, and that more awareness needs to be made about the issue. If the media and those with power refuse to speak about this topic then it is our duty as people with voices to take matters into our own hands and demand change. For the sake of our generation and the generations that follow us, it truly is our last hope.

After reading David Wallace-Welles article "The Uninhabitable Earth", I became extremely anxious about the current situation regarding our outlook and actions towards climate change. Sure, there are plenty of activists and posts on social media talking about helping the environment and curing it from our pollution, but is anyone actually doing anything. I do not believe he is too alarmist because even in the case that he was over exaggerating some of the circumstances and effects, it is not a bad thing to try and better the worlds around us. Also, Wallace-Welles includes numerous points of data and facts that further prove his argument throughout the article. If his objective aimed to startle or scare us into taking action and matters into our own hands then I believe that is just, because it is writers like him that spread the word to the public and make us aware of our own wrong doings. Although there is the dark aspect and violent side of the article, that is reality. Reality will be a dead Earth, and if that reality scares us then we must do something about it. 
  <br><br>


Reflecting upon the article, I felt the need to do something and take action against this battle that we as humans are ignoring. It is our responsibility to take care of our home, not someone else's. Taking an alarmist approach may alarm people too much but it also creates an environment where people spark a conversation about the topic and transform that fear into passionate change. The idea that our future is in the hands of us right now is not a new concept or idea, it just takes someone like Wallace-Welles to force ourselves to confront that reality. Most articles aim to be very middle of the road and mild in order to appeal to the majority but when it comes to climate change, it is clear that it is us against ourselves. The most disheartening section for me was the "Poisoning Oceans" portion. It makes me so upset that these animals who have no control over our actions are dying because of things that they do not cause. Humans control the fate of ourselves but ultimately the entire planet, and in order to save the planet we need to start at our own habits

In this article, David Wallace Wells succeeded in communicating the object by showing real events, scientific speculations, and reasonable hypotheses. Though climate change is indeed a serious problem, I held the thought that we still have enough time to deal with this crisis. However, this perspective turned out to be wrong after I read this article. More than just the rise of sea level, Wallace Wells points out 8 more serious consequences––heat death, the end of food, climate plagues, unbreathable air, perpetual war, permanent economic collapse, poisoned oceans, and the great filter––each of which is supported by real events and experts’ views. These factors complement each other, rather than being independent. What surprised me is that the global warming may also have impacts on GDP: Hsiang believes that every 1 degree Celsius increase leads to a 1.2% reduction in GDP. Moreover, the influence on food production and the economic system will cause damage to human society and culture. While the poisoned oceans and unqualified air make the planet an inanimate place to live.  
   <br><br>

To be honest, I feel a little bit hopeless after reading The Uninhabitable Earth. Just like the title of the first part of the article––‘Doomsday’, it seems like that it has been too late for people to change their destiny. I do not think that Wallace Wells is a somewhat over-react alarmist. The end of his article is not to freak people down but to let more and more people face the problem directly and do their best to solve the problem immediately. What makes me feel helpless is the fact that there is still too much uncertainty about the world, and we only have few laws to regulate our behaviors. 
   <br><br>

All in all, David Wallace Wells attracts people’s attention successfully by listing some possible serious consequences of global warming. Just as Wallace Smith Broecker pointed out in his article: the planet is an “angry beast”, and people are provoking it by emitting too much carbon to the atmosphere. Waking people up is only the first step and there is still a long way to go. If we do not take actions right now, we will kill ourselves in the near future.

The one degree increase in the global temperature since the Paris Agreement has made its optimistic ideals for the future seem foolish. Now, the global temperature is not only unlikely to stay below an increase of two degrees, but it is likely to surpass it. Davis Wallace-Wells succeeds in shocking the audience in the article "The Uninhabitable Earth". Prior to reading this, I thought that the author was going to list reasons as to why our actions have made some aspects of the environment unfavorable. I had no idea the extent of the dangers of human activities; from destroying our bodies, to the economy, to the land we walk on. Life as we know it will be gone if action doesn't take place now. 
   <br><br>
The approach Wallace-Wells took was the best that it could've been. At this point in time, scaring people with dreadful statistics is the only thing that might ignite something in the public to make changes in their daily lives. The severity of the situation is put into perspective not only when the nations that are part of the Paris Agreement failed to uphold its goals, but when it is mentioned that the only thing keeping it together is that they will "promise to try". This lack of urgency is the reason why the author presents the outcomes of the increased global temperature in a way that people may call "alarmist". He most certainly should, as changes haven't been made in the past from other approaches. The article did make me sad, and some of the outcomes he lists were completely foreign to me such as the climate plagues. I had no idea ice could contain diseases from prehistoric times that we haven't even encountered yet; diseases that wiped out civilizations in the past. Remnants of the 1918 flu that killed as many as 100 million people has been found in the ice of Alaska. The thought of disease resurfacing in such a manner that is already foreseeable is indeed terrifying, but is just another reason why action must be taken. Instead of taking a defeatist attitude, we should examine our own lives and implement differences that would collectively make a change.

It makes sense why some critics would entitle David Wallace-Welles' article "The Uninhabitable Earth" the work of an alarmist. The contents of this read are not one for the faint of heart, they're alarming, as the name would imply. I don't, however, agree with this insinuation. To dismiss this deeply thought-provoking narrative on the impending demise of our planet, supported by unequivocal facts and critical thinking as being nothing but over-exaggerated and sensationalist is just low-hanging fruit. Wallace-Wells sets out to create a prediction for what the world will look like should we hit our bench-mark laid by the Paris Agreement of two degrees warming as well as what will happen should we exceed this baseline. Frankly, these assumptions are not optimistic. While the chaos Wallace-Welles writes of may sound like some fantastical action movie, it's far from fiction but very clearly where the planet is headed if action is not taken, and quickly at that. 
   <br><br>

It's actually amazing how terribly bleak this article is, at each succeeding section an even heavier weight of realization began to settle upon me. From Doomsday, a plan actually made for the end of the world already being put into jeopardy; air so thick with carbon dioxide it won't even be possible to breathe; global conflicts ensuing even just based on irritations from the heat; all the way to an economic collapse that the government says they're so concerned about so they ironically drop all environmental concerns despite that being the main cause. Many of these realities I have heard analyses on, having been involved in climate change activism already, however the section on "Climate Plagues" was something I have heard mentioned briefly yet not to this degree of break-down. It was truly chilling to read "Ice works... as a climate ledger, but it is also frozen history, some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen." Yes, medical science is greatly advanced and saves many, but some of these diseases have not been encountered for thousands of years. The idea of an epidemic of such magnitude is petrifying. A bit ironic how Wallace-Welles mentions that the genre of dystopian futures is littered with zombies rather than climate change, but apparently a drastic virus could well be triggered by the melting ice-caps.
   <br><br>

This entire article was a massive chill to the spine, however one of the most impactful lines in my opinion came fairly early on when Wallace-Welles mentions our vicious pillaging of the earth's resources is exactly what "Wallace Smith Broecker... means when he calls the planet an 'angry beast'. You can also go with 'war machine'. Each day we arm it more." This just further cements the guilt of how this is almost entirely the fault of human action. It's hard to feel optimistic for the future when humanity is known to be incapable of believing until the see something, and fear if we wait to see the end of the world, well, that's probably a self-explanatory statement. No matter what the future is bleak, that's indisputable, but hopefully we can get out act together and fix things before they go too far, even further than they are now.

David Wallace-Well's "The Uninhabitable Earth" underscores a potential future outcome of climate change if we continue to not act. In my opinion,  Wallace did not come across as an alarmist, but his article did lack focus on hope and action. By glancing over these key features, he does create an opposing reaction to his objective. Nowadays, many young adults joke about not going to college or having life achievements if the world is inevitably going to end from climate change. Although they may not have serious intentions, this does highlight the effect of inciting action based on fear. 
   <br><br>

After reading the article, I personally did not feel any different from prior reading the article. It did not prompt me to do anything more than what I am already doing such as recycling, saving energy, etc. However, I do believe taking alarmist tactics can alienate certain readers. As I mentioned before, extreme fear can cause hopelessness of taking action for climate change in young people and skeptics. On the other hand, I think it is necessary to use pathos in impacting others into stopping global warming. For example, Greta Thunberg's speech internationally inspired a lot of people to take action in the movement due to her anger and disbelief. Her speech emphasized the fact that she is a child who has to do an adult’s job. Therefore, this can cause a self-reflecting moment for adults who have the power to push initiatives to prevent or further exacerbate climate change. Out of the consequences Wallace lists, I found the perpetual war topic as the most compelling. As student who took global warming last quarter, I never thought about how direct climate change can also lead to social conflicts. The discussion of the relationship between climate change and crime was very interesting because Wallace takes it one step further into the future. For example, many are aware of the melting ice causing a rise in sea level which will lead to others migrating, but the author underscores how that can cause irritability and an increase of crime due to human behavior.

In truth, I found Wallace's article to be a bit difficult to get through, and extremely disheartening. It is evident that Wallace is a very well educated man on the topic of climate change, and I am not disputing his claims in anyway as he presents an argument with strong evidence about the extremely dire consequences of climate change which have already come to fruition, or are quickly approaching. I feel that there are two sections of Wallace's article which stand out the most as the most alarming, and therefore, the most attention-grabbing. In the section titled, "Heat Death" Wallace argues that at 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half of the World's population would die of direct heat". Along with this, in the section titled, "Climate Plagues" he reveals that severely deadly diseases such as the bubonic plague and smallpox are suspected to be trapped in the  ice, meaning that if that ice were to melt, they could potentially be released. I found these two sections and facts to be the most compelling in the sense that they provide straightforward examples of the various ways in which climate change directly threatens human existence. While all sections of Wallace's article provide frightening ways in which climate change will continue to wreak havoc on the earth, these two sections in particular stood out as the most alarming. Finally, to answer one of Ken's questions, while Wallace makes a plethora of convincing points, overall I felt that the Wallace's negative tone was completely overpowering to the extent that it seemed the entire purpose of his article was to frighten the reader into action. While this approach may be useful in some instances, I feel that it can oftentimes backfire in the sense that one may be frightened into denial, left too afraid to try and take action, or with the feeling that nothing can be done.

It is no wonder to me that David Wallace-Wells’ “The Uninhabitable Earth” generated some controversy, as even a casual reader who comes across his article will hear the tone and urgency of his voice through his text. I have heard of the term “alarmists” before, and it’s notoriously recognized with a negative connotation, like a mother nagging- yet we forget the importance behind some of these nags. I think it is incredibly important also, to look and recognize how Wallace-Wells was able to write another publication years later titled, “We’re Getting a Clearer Picture of the Climate Future — and It’s Not as Bad as It Once Looked.” As opposed to the first article, from the headline alone, it can be deduced that Wallace-Wells was able to see some sort of improvement within that time frame, once again bringing him hope.

   <br><br>

Another crucial point to note about his work and his purpose with this article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” is that although he is incredibly negative and painting a much scarier picture than most scientists these days want to let on (in fear of being attacked, belittled, and questioned), Wallace-Wells is quite clear in that while it’s unlikely that we won’t hit these dangerous temperature rises, and that while many things are certainly no longer reversible no matter how hard we try anymore at this point, that that doesn’t mean we stop now and that we are set for doom. We are set for doom if we stay BAU (business as always) and we set for doom if we keep allowing or putting scientists in positions where they find the need to edit their own observations conscientiously, which ultimately harms us in that we do not get the seriousness of our status.
   <br><br>


Wallace-Wells, in my personal opinion, doesn’t come off as too much of an alarmist- but keeps things pretty real. He additionally seems to convey that he is only trying to portray one possible future he envisions (the negative one if things don’t change fast and now), viewing everything as an agenda. Holding the cut like others at 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of temperature rise is certainly too optimistic, and sadly, a goal now. The 2-4 degree Celsius rise that he pushes likely seems incredibly real, especially after reading his article from his point of view and description. In particular, he starts off early in the article about how most of us are alluded to these limited ideas sea levels rising and such- and what I thought was a huge issue, suddenly was demolished by him. That was a bit of a takeback, as this gave me a scale of how serious and how large of an issue we are facing. This is all media coverage influenced. In communication class, it overlaps with the Agenda Setting Theory. Perhaps it is those getting to us first for BAU, in order to lower our fear, and cause us to respond slower despite the severity and urgency of these situations. Undermining them before our eyes by only telling half-truths. Alarmist tack definitely takes away many readers, and it’s a risky choice, however, it puts the article in the right tone. Being timid with scientific language is a barrier of censorship. He focuses on an array of climate change consequences, but I see them as all interconnected, so I don’t feel one to be the most compelling, but all equally so.

The factual seven numbers given by Sarah Ruiz-Grossman and Lydia O’Connor in their article was all a wake-up call, but like stated, no matter how well-informed we seem to be, we really don’t seem alarmed enough. One thing that I did not entirely see eye to eye with, although it was understandable, I wouldn’t say we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers- but I’m biased, as I thought these movies (disaster movies) were all it. This seems to be the theme of this whole response- we don’t actually know what we’re going through, because of how we are conveyed these things. Media coverage (and lack of it, or censored versions of it) has shaped our perception to only see the surface level of these dangers, where they came from, and why they came about.

I find it very interesting that you mentioned  “We’re Getting a Clearer Picture of the Climate Future — and It’s Not as Bad as It Once Looked” because it goes to show that since the article was written there have been improvements in human attitudes and actions that brought about these changes, and makes for a good case an article like "The uninhabitable earth," although presenting quite pessimistic views of our planet's future, are crucial because it acts as a wake up call, and enables conversations and debates that ultimately will lead to some sort of solution.

<br><br>
I also really like that you mention media coverage, since it's truly fascinating how only a small group of people can influence and manipulate the attitude of entire populations. Just in 2019, we see how social medias freaked out over the notre dame catching on fire while the amazon burning barely got any attention in comparison.
<br><br>

Overall, although many would argue that Wallace Wells was being an alarmist in this article, I thought that he maintained a neutral tone throughout and was speaking about the issue of global warming from a fairly objective view, supported with tons of facts and evidence. I also don't think that there's anything wrong with being an alarmist, because as Wells noted in the annotated version, given the situation that we are in right now, we should all be very alarmed.
<br><hr>
Great thoughts you added on about Wallace-Wells and his supposed nature of being an "alarmist." Since I didn't feel the annoyance or nagging in his article, his article didn't seem like it was trying to be super negative and end-all, and rather, like you said is simply speaking about the issue of global warming with the facts. He doesn't try to use roundabout ways to address it, that's all, and that seems to be much less of an issue (if that is being an alarmist) than sugar coating our situations with inaccurate data and playing things down too much.

Wallace-Wells depicts the future of our planet if we don’t take much-needed action to combat the deadly effects of climate change in a graphic, yet realistic way. That being said, Wallace-Wells is not being “alarmist” at all because the fact of the matter is that he is not exaggerating nor creating unnecessary panic. Whether you’re a climate change denier or not, the issues we will come to face are more serious than we think. As Wallace-Wells said in his article, “But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough,” which is to pinpoint his motive in mind while writing this article. He writes in a way that begs us to worry and panic and feel attacked to create action. It may be difficult to get in that headspace if you’re currently not experiencing a hurricane or fire, but that doesn’t mean climate catastrophe isn’t taking place. Because of this, it is unreasonable to categorize Wallace-Wells as an alarmist. 
<br><br>


Personally, the article was a wake-up call because it made me appreciate how at the moment I can breathe non-toxic air, yet this may not be our reality in the future. Although the facts are saddening, the article overall made me feel alert and attentive to what I personally can do to get on board with combatting climate catastrophe. 
<br><br>


Under the section “The Great Filter” Wallace-Wells says how writer Amitav Ghosh explains the way in which humans essentially care more about their own story, rather than the fate of societal consciousness. As we know, climate change deeply affects all of us, so it’s ironic that some people may not pay attention to it. Wallace-Wells is aware of this so he portrays environmental devastation in a factual and alerting way to encourage readers to imagine their lives being inconvenienced by man-made destruction.

The Uninhabitable Earth does not seem to be very alarmist.  The possible consequences the article discusses are speculations that seem very probable given that there seems to be little change in humanity’s progress towards greenhouse gas emission reduction.  The situation expected in reaction to The Uninhabitable Earth seems similar to that of Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle.  Because The Jungle bluntly stated the horridly crude methods of meat production and other industrial processes, the people were spurred into action and were able to quickly achieve changes to the meat industry.  Wallace Wells does not discuss the horrors of the present, but illustrates the future that humanity it dooming itself to live in.  When people realize that the effects of climate change are not limited to the ocean levels rising a couple inches, they will pay more attention to climate change and put more effort into taking action against increasing greenhouse production.  The article rightly states that people have not realized the severity of the effects of climate change because they heed no attention to an issue that does not affect the area they live in (i.e. an issue that does not directly and immediately affect them).  While the alarmist tactic may alienate certain people, the critical thing is to convince most people that they should be supporting the movement against climate change.  
<br><br>

Upon reading this article, I felt compelled to do more research on the effects of climate change mentioned.  Though things such as climate plagues and mass heat death are predictions of what will happen, the fact that we are rapidly approaching conditions that will make these predictions a reality concerns me.  As someone whose future will be affected by climate change, I feel that it is important that I do what I can to support those who are making an effort to reversing the environmental damage that years of human carelessness has caused.

After reading the article by Wallace Wells, many of the worries that come to mind when people think about our climate crisis barely scratch the surface of what the consequences of our actions may be. From sea levels rising to global temperature increase, those are only some of the many consequences that contribute to the bigger picture. In the article, Wells states, “No matter how informed we are, we are not alarmed enough.” This holds to be true because the consequences of our actions are prevalent now more than ever. Reading about how permafrost  and how it was considered to be permanently frozen soil until it started melting and releasing unknown diseases that have been know to eradicate populations in the millions was astonishing. Not only does it contain diseases and bugs, but it also contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon that when thawed and released may evaporate as methane. Something to take into consideration is how this is life threatening to all lives on earth. 

<br><br>

To even think about how there are skeptics about climate change is worrisome because life on earth as of now is limited. 
<br><br>


When it comes to climate crisis, the conversation is always about how we should take action now. However, this has always been the motto. Throughout this lifetime, things have gradually become worse. The consequences for our actions are more prevalent than ever. The consequences as described in the article are not predictions, but are our schedule of we do not take action now. Wells is not an alarmist, though it may seem like he is, but he is presenting the public with knowledgable information that should be taken whole heartedly if we want change. Although one of Wells goal might have been to scare readers into changing their ways, it also prompted them to reflect on their actions and how they should reduce their carbon footprint on this planet.

I respect the alarmist approach to alerting people about climate change because sadly most people do not care about anything until their interests are the ones being threatened. Humans can be so apathetic to things even as terrifying as climate change, so if scaring people into feeling emotions and empathy is the only way to get them to make a change, then so be it. Perhaps if the conditions were not so dire, then maybe an alarmist approach would not be well suited, but at this point, we have limited time and few options to get people to wake up and change. 
    <br><br>
  The consequences that I found most compelling and worrisome was one, the thousands of diseases that have been buried under the ice, that are at risk of being released back into the air. Since a majority of the disease’s humans have not or ever encountered in many years, if they were to be released due to ice melting, we would be in serious trouble. Without the immunity built to combat these long-buried diseases, humanity would be sure to fall into a plague. Another consequence I found quite alarming was that with the rise of temperature came an increase in the rise of violence and armed conflict. As we all are quite aware of how cruel wars are, the thought that with the warming temperatures we would be most likely falling into more wars is scary.

The article Wallace-Wells was alarming and very upsetting to read because it is the truth. Considering the situation with climate crisis, Wallace-Wells' article did a great job at alarming his audience because it helps prevent what he refers to as climate denialism. It is clearly important to be aware of the possible outcomes and how the world could be impacted if action is not taken quickly. Throughout his piece, Wallace-Wells is able to respond to those who don't believe in the climate crisis and explains that denial isn't going to fix the prominent issues. For instance, he mentions the term "technocrats" to refer to those who deny the climate crisis by believing anything and everything is fixable. Wallace-Wells uses his article to prove to those who deny the climate crisis that without action it will not be fixable. He mentions a number of consequences, however one that caught my attention was the Climate Plagues. The fact that among many other disasters, that arctic ice melting can reintroduce old diseases that humans haven't been exposed to or experienced for a really long time resulting in our bodies being unable to combat them since they're so unfamiliar. Wallace-Wells is able to present his arguments in blunt form that isn't sugar coated which creates awareness and can provoke readers to take action.
    <br><br>
In the article I also appreciated that Wallace- Wells mentions the human relationship to nature has historically been about dominating nature. He  mentions the term for the current era "Anthropocene" which according to him means dominion over nature in a biblical sense. Clearly, most human beings have wrongly claimed dominion over nature therefore causing most humans to feel entitled to do what they please with animals, land, etc. Perhaps if there wasn't that foundation thinking amongst the majority of humans that nature is for them to abuse then more respect towards the planet would be more common. Overall, Wallace-Wells article was more than eye opening it is what Ken mentions in the video as our schedule or future that awaits us.

After reading the article “The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells, I think it is wrong and unfair to refer to Wallace-Wells as an “alarmist.” By definition, an alarmist is “a person who tends to raise alarms, especially without sufficient reason, as by exaggerating dangers or prophesying calamities.” While Wallace-Wells’ projections of the future may be terrifying and seemingly exaggerated, they are by no means unrealistic and should be treated as a strong warning. To consider him to be alarmist would undermine his scientific evidence aiming to inform the public of the frightful future ahead of us.
    <br><br>

As this was not the first time I read this article, reading it this time was more daunting than shocking. However, when I read it for the first time in ES1, it was extremely shocking and horrifying to learn about the future of our planet if we continue living this way, with little respect or care for the well-being of the Earth. Wallace-Wells’ tone throughout his article, especially in the beginning, pulls the reader in, claiming that global warming is worse than we think and that “parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable” by the end of this century.
    <br><br>

Out of all of the topics and examples of planetary destruction that Wallace-Wells mentioned in his article, I found the consequence of “climate plague” to be the most compelling. While this topic is not discussed very often, it is extremely dangerous to the survival of humanity and ecosystems around the world. Diseases trapped in Arctic ice that have not been in the air in millions of years may prove to be destructive to the immune systems of this day and age, and could “scramble” ecosystems, therefore threatening the natural balance of the Earth.

After reading the article, I do understand as to why David Wallace-Wells is deemed an alarmist by some people, it definitely caused me to feel alarmed and frightened for the apparent downfall and destruction of life on this planet. However, by taking on such a despairing and blunt view it does cause me to want to do something in order to halt such “destruction we’ve already baked into our future” as Wallace-Wells phrased it in his article. 
    <br><br>
When I finished reading this piece it did make me want to do something about climate change but I also felt very small in contrast to the extensive damage that's already been done. I'm not sure exactly what I could do to reverse that damage and if I did do something how will that help without millions of others also changing some aspects of their lives? We could not completely force millions who have become complacent with the world we now live in and make them change how they do certain things especially if they don't even believe that it is happening and that is what makes me feel powerless.
    <br><br>
The most compelling consequences that the article looks into was heat death. How he described the people are already suffering the consequences of high temperatures with kidney failure and how people in the future, if nothing is done about this crisis, wouldn't even be able to go outside was incredibly alarming.

The fight or flight response (Hyper-arousal) is the physiological reaction we endure in response to a harmful event, attack or threat to our own survival. This response is what is picked up when reading David Wallace-Well's, "The Uninhabitable Earth", and raises the greater question of him being too alarmist. The grim statistics and the foreshadowing of a possible future of an apocalyptic Earth at the hands of our inability to react on time to the raging climate crisis that is affecting us right now can make an individual feel helpless and paralyzed at the very possibility, even with titles such as 'Doomsday', 'The End of Food', and various other quotes. While on the other hand people may rise up from such a possibility to make drastic change to ensure such a future is inevitable from happening and take the statistics given by Wallace-Wells to heart. From reading the annotated version of his article, it becomes evident that the deeper reason he chose to right in such a grim way was to evoke a wider knowledgeable look at the climate crisis and the potential it can cause as he quotes that "the public does not appreciate the scale of climate risk; that this is in part because we have not spent enough time contemplating the scarier half of the distribution curve of possibilities", (Wallace-Wells, P.4). In essence, he wants the reader to be scared, scared of he possibilities that might come down on us if we don't change our ways to fight the climate change and for this reason is what makes him appear too alarmist and he takes that characterization to heart as he wants everyone to be alarmed of the consequences that our climate crisis will bring upon us if we don't act now as he stands as a climate change alarmist. But this action is crucial in making the public fully aware as fear is one of our strongest emotions and one of the very emotions that get humans to act, as in the flight or fight response. Do we hide and quiver to the inevitable doom that the climate change will bring us due to humanities greater inability to react to such phenomenon or do we fight the climate crisis and help the planet for the better? His deeper analysis of the consequences in the chapter called "The End of Food" was the most compelling of them over the fact that food is a major component of human culture and human life and without it, famines would decimate the human populous all across the planet. This idea of an inevitable famine strikes home as food is something most of us are use to being accessible easily through the doors of our refrigerators, but that possibility could wash away if we don't act now to the greater climate crisis. 

    <br><br>

In the overall arch of this article given to us by David Wallace-Well, his deeper reasons to evoke fear among his very own readers was to educate them on the wider consequences of the climate crisis that we are slowly acting upon and to our inevitability to change, a dark a gloomy future full of suffering by our own hands. This fear tactic in educating the readers is what makes him appear as a climate change alarmist, but in affects can split the readers into either fight or flight which is a consequence of such tactic. I for myself, have felt more of a reason to fight the climate change issues developing across the world as for myself, I cannot depict a future living in a 'hellscaped' Earth by our own hands, and I believe many of us feel that same way looking forward to having our own families etc. But in general, David Wallace-Wells takes on the alarmist persona as an effort to educate his readers to see the broader consequences that that may develop through our lack of knowledge the climate change as there are more the book than the cover.

“ The Uninhabitable Earth” by David Wallace-Wells was an interesting read, although his alarmist nature was quite transparent in the article. In his section of “Heatdeath”, Wells drew many examples from the results of an 11-12 degree warming: “...half of the world’s population...would die from direct heat”. If we as a species somehow manage to screw up that far, we would have longed been dead by other factors, most notably wars over resources. His alarmist nature, however, is justifiable in the sense that his purpose or the article is not just to inform, but also to scare the readers into making changes. He recognized that some people, especially the deniers, do not think of this disaster as a problem and will continue to live their selfish lives. Thus, he had to go to the extreme to get some changes. Deadlines are after all the greatest motivators. Aside from some of his more far-fetched claims, he did bring up some quite imminent consequences. Wells’ section on “Perpetual War” and “Permanent Economic Collapse” are most likely what will happen first if the climate crisis is not attended to. As droughts become more severe and land more inhabitable, massive migrations patterns will occur from agrarian cultures to the cooler north and thus competition for housing and food will be more competitive. With most of the world’s food supply coming from the agriculture scene as well, having a lack of farmers will seriously hinder growth. Naturally, as expected from humans, as resources become more scarce, people will be more and more competitive over it, and not for long there will be an all-out war over a meal. This, in my opinion, is more likely the death sentence for humanity instead of dying from direct heat, but I guess it wouldn’t be as dramatic.

I agree the lack of resources that the climate change could cause if conditions are not improved will lead to violence. This scenario unlike the other ones provide in the article seems like the most believable simply because we have seen it occur throughout history, wars fought for land and its resources. As mentioned in lecture, as people migrate to more favorable areas for living and seek food, the poorer communities will be effected the most, while the weather class will probably use their influence. I think the climate injustice could lead to even more conflict in the future.

In the article," The Uninhabitable earth" by David Wallace-Wells, Wallace-Well addresses the possible outcomes of global challenges around the world and alarms the audience the possible problems that can face if we don't make changes to our daily lives. Wallace-Wells emphasizes that the people are never fully aware of what is going on in the world and only know a "scratch" of the scenario. Wallace-Wells is trying to engage with the audience by using similar situations to connect with the audience, so they can get a better understanding of climate crisis and how our lifestyle affects the climate and the world. He is very formal with his writing structure by emphasizing how the past events can affect our future events. In addition, he stresses how the climate change is a very essential to all living things, and it can affect survival whether the temperature is too high or low.This worries me because if the temperature increase, it can allow for more diseases to grow and evolve allowing many living organisms to get contaminated and can cause more issues to evolve. Because of abnormal temperature, it can also affect our food supply and can depreciate the amount able to receive. He  informs how the abnormal temperatures can affect survival by stating, "as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them..." This implies how living in abnormal temperature can be a huge problem.

After reading this article, I gain a better understanding how climate change can a be a huge problem, but we should also learn different ways on how to make the world a better and healthier place. I am just a little bit worried because of the possible issues that can arise if we don't fix our lifestyles. I just wonder if there are different possible way to bring it to the audience attention.I am afraid that people aren't aware of what is going on in the real world, and people should know more than a scratch of the information that they are being informed with.

Although every number that gets stated brings my hope lower and lower, I am glad that I was able to read Wallace Well's article about the effects of climate change because it really opened my eyes to even more details of our world's plight. As Ken says in his video, many authors focus on the 1.5-2 degrees Celsius increase in the world's temperature. These numbers are the ones I was used to seeing or hearing about but I didn't realize that they were the best-case scenario. Eight degrees seems like an awfully large rise in temperature. It is odd to think of how fast the world is warming when I still shiver on my walk to the dining commons for dinner. 
    <br><br>
Wallace Well's use of worst-case scenario statistics make for a shocking, but effective approach to informing his readers about what the world is heading towards. This "alarmist" approach probably does deter potential readers. It may simply be too much negative information all at once. I had to take breaks between sections. But those that read through the entire article are much better educated in what is most likely on the way. Therefore, I do not think Wallace Well's approach is necessarily "alarmist." Sure, his work may scare people, but it not an unnecessary scaring. If we are to take action to bring the world back onto a successful path to surviving and stopping climate change, we need a powerful motivator.
    <br><br>
One of the more scary consequences Wallace Well's states in his article would probably have to be the warning of perpetual war, especially with the current chatter and actions between the Middle East and our president. The world is a pretty scary place.
    <br><br>
After reading the article, I felt depressed about all of the consequences that are a snowballing result of climate change. However, I feel hopeful to learn about ways to combat one the greatest obstacles that my generation must face from this class.

What really seems to be the strategy behind the enlightenment Wallace-Wells hopes to provide is the provocation to acknowledge that all that the modern era takes for granted will soon become a source of pain and sadness as a result of our own actions. It is brought up thatwe will lose our security in food, land, and safety: necessities that have become equated with natural rights in our relatively comfortable political lifestyle. Yet with this knowledge of impending discomfort, the issue is pushed off because it doesn’t affect us right now, as is the same topic of the less comfortable current conditions of other countries when discussed. The subject that stuck me the most is that of disease and illness. My health is something I absolutely take for granted, and sickness is something that western medicine has forced into an almost distant memory for those who can afford it. The amount of people who no longer die from illness at a young age is unprecedented, and when Wallace-Wells brings up the statistics for the amount of people who might die in the case of a new, melt-induced epidemic, my personal hopes for a future family and comfortable life felt slightly assaulted. The importance of science is emphasized following these devastating revelations, yet as a reader I have been left in a bit of a hopeless and fearful state. 
     <br><br>

I found interesting the discussion of “deep time” and its contrast with “everywhen”: these surreal moments, experiences, and happenings that are incomprehensible and un-lifelike. What a wonderful analogy to make surrounding climate change as a whole. As controversial a topic as it is, categorizing the apocalyptic conditions of our impending environmental state as mythical and surreal can be agreed on by those who both believe and oppose the scientific debate. Additionally, I found the matter of the lifespan of an industrial civilization an interesting thought as well. This brings to mind the age old debate of free will: if it is written into the code of our species that we can only survive so long as an industrial civilization, it almost invites us to conclude that nothing can be done and our fate was predetermined by the engineers who have made our modern life so simple. No lawsuit can save the future from fate, and it would be hard to argue that the trade-offs haven’t been worth the benefit when thinking of the luxuries we enjoy today. The thematic question that I feel stems from this consideration is what can actually determine how much power human civilization has on our environment, and what percentage of that power could ever be considered “control”.

When you talk about the continuing climate crisis, it is hard not to sound alarming. From old diseases melting out of icebergs to water rising high enough to flood cities, the topic sounds almost as nerve wracking as the movie “2012”. However, this is not a movie. In fact, Wells’s article well explains just how real of a situation it is. 
     <br><br>

I was particularly drawn to the fact that climate change could cause the resurfacing of prehistoric disease and the release of seemingly gone diseases from melting ice. While the idea of catching a cough strong enough to kill a mammoth is alarming, that was not the most concerning part of this section of the article. I found that the fact that I had never even thought of that before to be the most alarming. Branching from this idea, my imagination wonders and reaches to other places that a changing climate might go. What else could climate change do? What other surprising effects could it have on the world aside from making it hotter and hotter? It reminded me how connected the world is, specifically how impactful one change can be in relation to other seemingly stable things.
     <br><br>

After reading such a scary topic, I did feel rather “called to action”. I figured that I might as well eat more vegetables, walk more places, and reduce my carbon footprint as much as I can. While my personal input to the world’s carbon levels are essentially neglectful, I still feel like I should try and act as a role model for my peers, acting on a local level instead of global in the hopes that others will do the same and increase our ability to lower our impact on the Earth.
     <br><br>

It is easy for people to write someone off as a chest-banging, human blaming preacher. It’s especially easy to do when the topic at hand is one so debated as the climate crisis. While the evidence is available to all people, and is spread out through the news, a lot of people still find themselves trying to discredit claims that the climate is changing. People love to reference the snow season they had at their local ski resort, talk about how they wear hoodies in summer still, and say “it was just raining the other day, what drought?” It is for people like this that I fear Wells’s article may skip over. When this kind of person already has a hard time believing the fact that change is occuring, an article that dives into such dramatic scenes (even if the scenes are accurate depictions of the future) will be swept off their shoulders and disregarded as just another author trying to make headlines on a “red herring”. My fear is that people who already are familiar with the material will read for the value it has, while people who don’t want to accept the information will skim over it and move on unaffected. I usually find articles that focus more on explaining the scientific bits he quoted more able to capture the attention of people who would consider Wells just a classic alarmist.

In the article “The Uninhabitable Earth”, David Wallace-Wells states that global warming and other issues have made the earth uninhabitable. Before reading this article, I never feel that I cannot do anything for the climate when I read some news related to greenhouse effect and climate crisis. Wallace tries to make us realize how serious the climate changes are over years. As an alarmist, he successfully persuades me to rethink about the climate crisis happens around, which causes me to feel fearful.
     <br><br>

Each section of this article introduces me to different topics related to climate crisis. Even if I am not so interested in some of the topics like the “perpetual war”, other topics such as the “end of food” does draw my attention and sound the alarm bell among people. These various topics give me the general idea of how the earth is going to be in the incoming future. It motivates me and other readers to put some efforts on saving the earth we are standing on. Even though some people consider Wallace an alarmist and ignore his warning, I still believe that the facts and predictions listed in this article are convincing and close to the reality. With this in mind, we should not wait for worse outcome but begin to protect our land right now.

While David Wallace-Wells distinctly chose an alarmist stance within the article “The Uninhabitable Earth,” it is entirely necessary in the characterization of an issue that affects the population of the planet as a whole. He accurately describes the challenge that comes with facing what he describes as “the poisonous miasma of social fate.” In the span of human history, there has never been a global conflict as monumentally dire as the climate crisis and in turn, the human population struggles to swallow what feels intangible in daily life, not immediately solvable without severe lifestyle and/or societal shifts, and devastatingly terrifying for the fate of the human species. It is true that his tone of urgency might incapacitate readers with fear or turn them away all together; however, there is no time to dwell in fear and denial or to ride on the comforting wings of hope. Wallace-Wells’ bluntness within this article is essential as it provides a greater awareness of the urgency of the matter, molding a more educated general public and snapping readers into action.

Before I read the article, I was not aware of the grand number of consequences that could come from the warming of the planet and how the planet may soon face an inevitable end because of climate change. Throughout the article, I was familiar with some of the main consequences of global warming that were presented, such as if the planet warmed, there would be heat consequences and the sea levels may rise, taking out coastal cities. But, on the other hand, there were also consequences that I had not thought of before, such as dormant bacteria reincarnating as permafrost melts and inevitable economic downfall as the temperature rises due to a decrease in global productivity. In addition, other consequences I was not as familiar with included how war between countries would increase almost double by the next century and ocean acidification if we continue on the path of self-destruction. 

     <br><br>

I believe the purpose of this article was to show people what Earth will be like if we continue to live the way we are living. When the audience read this article, they began to understand the severity of climate change and how it may begin to affect their own lives within the next century, if not sooner. This article almost serves as a call-to-action and to bring awareness to the consequences that may occur if the planet continues to warm so that people would be more conscious of the environmental decisions they are making in their everyday life. In this day and age, there is a lot of propaganda that goes around surrounding if climate change is real; this article refutes those claims by backing up that climate change is real with scientific evidence that would be hard to ignore. This reading makes me feel like I should be doing more to lessen my carbon footprint in an attempt to slow warming if only by a little.

This week’s reading proved to be a strong and convincing wakeup call as to what our planet will look like and the devastating effects that will ensue if we do nothing to change our current bad habits. David Wallace lays out many possible arguments of the future we’re headed towards, which is at the same time terrifying as it as alarming. While reading it, I’ll admit that it was depressing and seemed like an unending list of all the terrible things that could ensue because of our long history of abuse upon the Earth. The way he simply moved on from discussing our slow but eventual death from the air we breathe poisoning us, to the plausibility that we will spend the rest of our numbered days in conflict which increases by 10-20% for every half a degree increase in temperature, and so on, made it seem as if there was no escape from the reality of our eventual mass extinction. Although, once I had reached the end of the article and was able to take in each possible scenario, I realized that he scares us in order to get across the urgency of this issue. He repeatedly states that scenarios, such as a rising number of dead zones in oceans or a 50% decrease in the size of our economy, will occur only if we choose to do nothing about our current practices. It becomes obvious that David Wallace is simply trying to alarm us to the consequences of continuing to burn fossil fuels or ignorantly driving to work when you could just as easily take public transportation.   
     <br><br>
It can be perceived that the intended audience for his article is educated individuals who have the knowledge and future capabilities to work towards changing our habits in order to prolong the planet we live on. With the pessimistic and nearly extremist view that he pursues throughout the article, it would most likely scare off and dishearten uneducated individuals who instead feel that they must accept this certain death. I don’t believe that that’s the intent of the article at all, and I instead feel that Wallace is presenting us with this argument in order to persuade a call to action from us. When he provides us with alarming statistics such as the drastic effects that an increase in temperature would have on the climate of certain regions, the 10% decrease in crop yields for every one-degree increase of warming, and the potential release of antiquated diseases like smallpox as ice caps continue melting, he doesn’t intend to terrify, but rather intends to provoke an understanding that we must change our current ways.

Wallace-Wells strove to highlight the various potentially devastating paths our Earth is barreling down in his article; I feel that his apocalyptic approach, while dismal and depressing, is a necessary one. Although this article may have been critiqued for being too alarmist, particularly by those practicing what Wells describes as “scientific reticence”, I believe that the content he is addressing necessitates such a warning. The climate crisis is alarming. The situation we have created for ourselves is dire. The consequences of inaction are immense and disastrous. He certainly succeeded in frightening me, more so than I was prior to reading, though he may argue not enough. I feel that there is no greater incentive than a threat to our lives. After reading the article, I feel it would be difficult for me to turn a blind eye, though I can understand why others may find it paralyzing; as Wells' article focuses on the hypothetical outcomes of the Earth’s future, he does not specify what to do about it. It is truly up to the reader to decide how to process this information. Due to this, there is certainly a risk in presenting the article as such; some will be immobilized by the overwhelming horrors bound to ensue sans action, while others will do anything, if at all possible, to avoid Wells' grim predictions. Specifically, I found the climate plague category particularly interesting, as I have never previously considered the possibility of such an outcome. Many of the other categories, while extremely pertinent, have been warned extensively and frequently, where I regrettably find myself desensitized to their threat.

Wallace certainly paints a grim picture in his piece “The Uninhabitable Earth.” It is no surprise why many label him as an alarmist with an ambitious goal to scare people into action-- because for me, he did just that. It is shocking to see limited concern the majority people have with regards to climate change, and it seems as if the only way to shake people out of complacency is to initiate panic. Wallace is writing this article by way of those who are unconcerned, and gives multiple examples of the harsh realities humanity will inevitably face if action is not immediately taken. Humans need to see the climate crisis as a pressing issue, and this is one necessary take at spreading awareness. The article is not entirely pessimistic; more so, it is communicating earth’s current climate timeline and its devastating effects. 
     <br><br>


With the way the information was delivered, I often felt as if a solution was out of reach and there was absolutely nothing that I could do as an individual to help. Though it was daunting and seemingly hopeless, I felt empowered to at least try and jump into action. I found the part of the article that discussed the human body’s reaction to increasing temperatures to be the most unsettling. The fact that over a quarter of men in the sugarcane regions of El Salvador have chronic kidney disease presumably due to heat and dehydration working fields that were once comfortably harvested in recent decades was startling. Climate change is becoming an increasingly more critical and pressing situation with each year, which is very scary to think about.

<p>
After I read the Uninhabitable Earth, I felt motivated to create change. Although the descriptions of what the future may look like seemed frightening, I felt inspired to continue to do my part because trying is better than not trying at all. However, I do believe that articles that look to create fear in the reader are not always the best route to go when trying to get people to stop climate change. This is because some people might feel so overwhelmed by the information they they either choose to not do anything about it because it all seems too hopeless or they choose to deny it altogether because it seems too crazy to actually be real. I believe the best method is to create fear in the reader, but also create positivity and hope as well. People need to be scared about the future, but optimistic that their little part has the capacity to create change. However, everyone reacts differently to things and sometimes different approaches can work hand in hand. As a result, I do still think it's important to display a variety of works, some using the approach of optimism, while other using that of alarmism. On a side note, I thought that hearing about fossil capitalism was very interesting and how the main reason for capitalism's growth was more so contributed to fossil fuels rather than new innovations. This makes me hopeful that we can have a friendlier relationship with capitalism in the future through the use of more sustainable resources and energy.

Wallace’s article is morbid, and left me very hopeless in determining whether there was even a plausible chance in combating climate change. But I would not call Wallace an alarmist. Every detail of the terrifying world that Wallace outlined is sure to happen if we do not act quickly. We live in a world where the United States (the second largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions) pulled out of the Paris Agreement. It is clear that those who have the most power and can create the largest impact are not alarmed.
     <br><br>


A piece in Wallace’s article that I found compelling was the end of food. Wallace highlights how we already live in a world with 800 million malnourished inhabitants. We will likely be feeding a population twice as large, with only half the amount of food. What I find the most heartbreaking about this is that those who are causing the most damage, have the resources to ensure their populations survive in the midst of climate catastrophe. Those in advanced countries have the money to ensure that they stay fed in the midst of food shortage. While those in impoverished countries will likely die out due to starvation. It is unfair that those causing the most environmental degradation are also those who will be the least affected by the damage they cause.

     <br><br>

Forced migration is another devastating consequence of climate change. For example, Bangladesh has been sinking and will soon be uninhabitable, forcing the population to relocate. If the same phenomenon were to occur in more affluent areas like the coast of California, we would have enough money to relocate people, and construct barriers to help with rising sea levels. 

     <br><br>

While Wallace’s article did spur me to take action, it left me feeling very hopeless. Individual action is important but I feel we do not have a chance unless there is an immediate change in policy.

In his article, David Wallace-Wells highlights many of the possible outcomes associated with the climate crisis and the rise of global CO2 emissions. Although this article is indeed terrifying to read, I think at this point, such cold hard facts are necessary to shake people and get them to realize how desperate of a situation this really is. In the past, psychologists believed hope was the best way to move people into action. However, thus far, this approach has not worked well in our favor. Not enough action has been taken in response to this growing problem, which is why scientists, journalists and influencers are starting to question psychologists’ initial conclusion and are turning to a more point blank approach. Wallace does a great job of this, painting a terrifying picture of what the future might hold. However, as Ken mentioned in the second video, I don’t believe all of these scenarios will come true, since hopefully humans will realize sooner rather than later this pressing issue and will start making radical changes. 
     <br><br>
After finishing the article, I was left shocked. However, I didn’t drop me into inaction. It made me realize how quickly we need to move in order to save the human race before it is too late. Something that I had never thought about before in regards to the climate crisis that is mentioned in the article is that it could create wars. I had never thought of putting the two together, as they seem so independent from each other. If humans are fighting each other while others are trying to search for solutions, there is no end in sight. All nations need to work together in order to even potentially get ourselves out of this mess.
     <br><br>
Finally, the numbers that Ken gave at the end of the video are simple proof that this crisis is real. I struggle to understand people who don’t believe climate change exists or choose to ignore it. These facts, along with the article, should be way more than enough to convince anyone and everyone that climate change is real and is here to stay until we as humans decide to do something about it.

I thought I had a reasonable understanding of the climate crisis before I read David Wallace-Wells's article. I have been told throughout my life that sea levels are rising due to the melting ice caps and that issue will cause global chaos due to migrations and eventual overpopulation. However, this article made me reconsider everything I thought I knew about the climate crisis, beginning with the first sentence of the piece.
     <br><br>


Wallace-Wells broke the climate crisis down into multiple sections, with Climate Plagues and Poisoned Oceans being the most compelling consequences to me. I learned that there are ancient diseases that have been trapped in ice for millions of years. As the permafrost melts, these diseases could be re released into the world and create epidemics of large proportions. This is alarming to me because in a world that is becoming more and more affected by globalization, terrible diseases will be able to spread and become worldwide. I feel like because countries want their big businesses to succeed in order to boost the economy, they have ignored the fact that they are slowly eliminating themselves and that some financial decline is worth saving the planet. I learned that the oceans absorb a lot of the carbon in the atmosphere, which causes problems for ocean life. A lot of the world survives off of marine life, so this issue is very important to me. The ocean is becoming more and more acidic, which could make the food dangerous to eat. This consequence to me was very compelling because it directly impacts a large amount of the population. Coral reefs, the habitats for a large part of marine life, are dying, and with them a quarter of marine life. This marine life in reefs supplies about five hundred million people with food. Overpopulation is already thinning out our food source, and it is very concerning that we are unconsciously destroying the food source for so many people.
     <br><br>


After finishing the article, I felt like the planet was doomed. There were so many things that can and will go wrong in the next century that I was questioning whether it was even possible to fix. I was struggling to think of something that one person could do to deal with such a large problem. After thinking about it, however, I realized that I am not alone. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are doing their best to save this planet, and if I set an example for others to follow, that is a step in the right direction.
     <br><br>


I don't think Wallace-Wells is too alarmist in this article. I think he presents the facts in an educated manner and it is scary to some because the consequences of the climate crisis are indeed frightening. This could drive people away, as the concept of a worldwide climate disaster is daunting and really seems impossible to solve. Initially, I was troubled with all of the statistics and facts he was presenting. When I stepped back and thought of it from a different perspective, one that was more logical and allowed me to be persuaded easier, I realized that these facts were not so implausible. He was using science to say what could happen in the future if we don't do anything about our current situation. To me, the best motivator is necessity, and after reading this article I am motivated to do something for the environment out of necessity for our planet.

In the article "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells, David outlines some of the potential outcomes that could occur if human actions as a global community continue as they are and climate change continues to grow and be a problem across the globe. In the article, he lists many of these possible scenarios as likely to come to fruition such as poisoned oceans, climate plague, perpetual war, and unbreathable air to name a few. With these extremely alarming, and at points seemingly far fetched possibilities for what could happen if the human race does nothing, some people list Wallace-Wells as an alarmist and discount his arguments are invalid as people say he is just trying spark action through extreme views. I however do not share this viewpoint as Davids commentary on the climate crisis is well formed and constantly backed up with credible research and even acknowledges that these things may not end up happening. All Wallace-Wells is contending is that if current trends in human behavior stay the same than we are risking these scenarios becoming a reality which is not far fetched as he backs up these points with statistical evidence that draws a clear trend in certain issues and conveys where these trends will lead the human race and the world.
     <br><br>
After reading this article my head felt slightly crammed with all of the new information I had just digested. I now realize how uninformed I was on the potential effects of climate change and I now feel more knowledgeable and able to speak on the subject. Out of all of the different topics that Wallace-Wells covered the one consequence to climate change that I found the most compelling was the the one that spoke on the topic of climate plagues. The reason this consequence stood out to me was because I had never thought of such a consequence ever before and was surprised that global warming could relate to diseases and plagues around the world. I learned that in the Arctic Ice there are diseases that are trapped and could be released into the world with no known cure if the ice caps in Antarctica continue to melt which could emerge as prehistoric plagues. In addition I also was informed that as temperature increases, so does the tendency of parasites to reproduce faster which makes climate change ever the more dangerous.

<p>
I can understand how some people would consider the dangers of the “alarmist approach,” but I still think all of Wallace-Wells’ points are valid. Learning about the direness of the planet’s situation can be overwhelming, especially considering how the Paris Climate Agreement consists of limiting global warming to two degrees, but still “cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to inhabitable.” This means that even if we manage to achieve these goals, which is unlikely according to Wallace-Wells, there would still be catastrophic damage. Despite the immense threat of global climate change, I don’t believe that this is enough reason to just give up entirely. Many adopt the attitude of waiting for the government or big corporations to instigate the change because as a single person, one might feel powerless to help save the environment. If we reinforce this idea within society, then there will never be any significant change.
      <br><br>
While Wallace-Wells introduced many compelling arguments, I was most fascinated by how certain diseases could have been “trapped in Arctic ice,” such as smallpox and the bubonic plague. The notion that deadly plagues from the past could return had never crossed my mind, and I wonder if the rest of the world is unaware of this consequence as well. This just reminds me of how there are more dangers to climate change than just the surface level issues of the weather becoming warmer. I also found the concept of perpetual war very compelling where “for every half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and a 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict.” There is no direct correlation between war and the environment, but the demand/supply for agricultural goods is affected by climate which is crucial to relations between countries. Overall, I found this article to be very informative on the most severe consequences of global warming, even if it was frightening to hear.

Although I also do not believe that there can be a direct correlation between the increase in temperature and the aggression that a nation may feel, I do think that the idea of war because of climate change and how that affects our planet is extremely interesting. There are already human rights violations for certain goods that are not even essential to daily living, such as the cultivation of blood diamonds or conflict diamonds that originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and Sierra Leone. When colonists or imperialists arrive in specific lands in which they find the resources that they deem economically, socially, or biologically vital to their nation’s existence, then powerful countries will abuse their current militaristic manpower and technology to gain those resources. If non-renewable resources continue to rise in scarcity, I do not see how these reasons would be any different to start imperialism amongst the larger countries, such as the Big 5. Nations are already starting to seize more land for jurisdiction, resources, and power, such as China throughout the South China Sea. Larger countries are also placing military support and weapons, as well as influencing political elections, within less-developed nations. I do not see what would stop the larger, more powerful countries, from gaining non-renewable resources if they had the ability to do so.

After reading David Wallace-Wells The uninhabitable (or at least unwelcoming earth), I was quickly overrun by a combination of feelings including dread, guilt, and fear. Wallace-Wells did a fantastic job if his objective for this article was to scare people into taking climate change seriously as well as reminding people of the grave consequences if we continue to warm our planet at the immense rate we are now. Just looking at the title of the article, you can immediately see that Wallace-Wells was going for a very doomsday-esque type of goal in order to get people to react to the negative results of climate change. While this type of writing, in which the author wants to shock people into getting them to act upon a certain issue, can be very useful in certain cases, I feel that Wallace-Wells may have gone just slightly too far when explaining the future of the world as a result of climate change. About halfway through the article, my imagination started to take over for the worse. I started to take the facts and estimates put forth by Wallace-Wells, as well as his own description of the planet, and before I knew it I was scaring myself into submission. This article relied too heavily on the “doom and gloom” alarmist method. I felt like crawling back into my bed and just staying isolated until the overwhelming feeling of doomsday passed over me after about 15 minutes. Although Wallace-Wells did write a book and follow up article that included a somewhat more positive outlook on the effects of climate change on our planet, I feel that this article is too startling and might scare off people from taking action to reverse the effects of climate change so far. While he is too alarmist, Wallace-Wells does a good job in terms of laying out the variation of destruction that could be brought about from climate change. He touched on every aspect from economic collapse, to deadly new diseases, to perpetual war, and many other topics. He goes into depth for each one of these topics, laying out a somewhat realistic view of what might happen if we continue down the path of climate change that we are currently on.

Before reading the article by Wallace, I was expecting to see a normal economic activist challenging for future changes. Even after watching the intro video by Ken, I still held an “as-usual” attitude, thinking I would not be convinced to take action. However, when I read the first part “Doomsday” of the passage, a never experienced sense of bleak and gloom surrounded me. Especially the sentence “But those scenarios, and not the present climate, are the baseline. In fact, they are our schedule.” Using a definite tone, Wallace starts from a specific point of 2 degrees temperature rise in the Paris Agreement and begins his argument by presenting cold hard facts and objective reality to the vast audience. The long history of Anthropocene, especially starting in 18 century where burning fossil fuels comes to the stage of history, has grabbed several factors into account, respectively Heat Death, The End of Food, Climate Plagues, Unbreathable Air, Perpetual War, Permanent Economic Collapse, Poisoned Oceans. Actually, from my perspective, these factors are not loosely separated. In fact, they are interrelated to each other, like the blind chase for economic growth will lead to more fuel burnt and consistent heating, thus bringing up problems such as famine, plagues, and air pollutions. We should consider all those points as a map, rather than a one-way straight line. 

     <br><br>

As for the aspect of alarmist--it’s true that the way Wallace addresses his claim will make him lost some audience, and sometimes some factors, in my opinion, is a little far-fetched, like the Perpetual War one. But it is delivering the truth. Furthermore, as the summary in the last paragraph, people will finally see the consequences of human interventions shortly Thus, truth is the most thing we should not avoid. And actually, I’m from the most polluted city Shijiazhuang in northern China. So when I was exposed to the air pollution part in 2013, I felt strongly related to the facts and portrays of my hometown. Therefore, with the premise of the exigency, it’s understandable that the author will be somewhat alarmist. And after all, it really lets you think and worry about the environment, which in any sense enlarge the group of people planning to take action for the career.

The big takeaway from "The uninhabitable earth" for me was the number of ways climate change could kill us all, aside from "just" sea-level rise. The thing that this comment gets right is that all of these problems are interconnected and will make each other worse. Famine makes diseases worse - and diseases reduce the number of farmers, reducing harvest sizes. Heat makes both problems worse, both by relocating diseases and by making diseases harder to fight. Relocation movements from cities devastated by sea-level effects, in a frighteningly common chorus, will similarly make everything worse. Everything is connected, which means that the bottom dropping out of several key foundations helps take down our human civilization all the faster.
     <br><br>

Honestly, that's the big reason why "The uninhabitable earth" and its follow-up clarification "Things may not be as bad as we thought" inspired so much helpless fury in me. I felt a certain sense of unfairness: existing in a world, being able to see the crisis, and lacking the power to avert civilization from said disaster. Ultimately, though, fury won out; if there really was no chance to save the human civilization, I don't want to find out about that until I'm dead. 
     <br><br>


Call Wallace alarmist - sure, call me alarmist - but I think he was entirely right, and I'm afraid that the people who most needed to understand his point are the very same people who have found and will continue to look for ways to dismiss his argument as "too alarmist" and "too radical". I feel very strongly that if you understand that the  "moderate" solution ends with hundreds of millions of people dead, then you had best be a radical.

As the article clearly displays, climate change is urgent. It is not a problem to be contemplated and saved for future discussion, it is something that requires action now. However, it is clear by the lack of political or cultural change that many of Earth’s citizens see no reason or urgency for action, and we continue to release an increasing amount of greenhouse gases. So why does nobody care? The answer must be, as Wallace-Wells suggests, that the problem we are facing is too abstract. The average person who is not well-versed in climate science may be overwhelmed and indifferent to the terms. Parts per million? Though it is one of the key measurements for climate science, describing the fraction of carbon dioxide in our air, it is also not a commonly used or understood measurement and means nothing to most people. I had to google it. Figures describing the numerous tons of chemicals that are contained or released are staggering, but also quite difficult to wrap one’s brain around. We use tons to weigh trucks going on freeways or weight capacity for ships. But 1.8 trillion tons of carbon contained in permafrost is a much more difficult number to understand, just by the sheer largeness it insinuates.
     <br><br>
I don’t believe Wallace-Wells is too alarmist. I think what he says is absolutely necessary. Most people will not care about the issue if it is not easy to picture. So that is what Wallace-Wells provides. He describes the very tangible consequences of failing to act on climate change. Heat-caused deaths, less food, drowned cities, and increased likelihood of war are all events that are certain to draw attention. Generally, people make better decisions when they are aware of the consequences of their chosen path. As a population, we need to understand the consequences of our actions if we choose not to curtail our use of climate change. Wallace-Wells has provided a great outline of our future Earth if we take no action. Now, with climate scientists around the globe having produced numerous reports of the bleak future of our society if it continues on its current path, it is time for us to wake up.

I agree with what you are saying about how most people won't be scared by numbers. Detailed descriptions of the horror that is it come is a better way at getting people to understand the urgency of the matter.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that many people are not well-educated about the problem we are facing because it is too abstract. Even if we do know about some statistics, it might still be difficult for us to imagine what exactly do the numbers mean. This also connects back to Wallace-Wells’ idea that “our uncertainty about uncertainty [...] stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible.”

The article by Wallace Wells contained an overall frightening message but it was one that needed to be said. Although many people claim that his message was too alarmist I disagree, mainly because we can't continue to sit around waiting for the climate to implode. We need action and that is exactly why Wallace Wells wrote this article. I do believe that his accumulation of climate change disasters will alienate some individuals however, more people hearing what will happen if action isn't taken soon will benefit in the near future. 
     <br><br>
When reading his article I was most shocked by the fact that if the permafrost was too completely melt that there could be an outbreak of century old diseases such as the bubonic plague or anthrax which was already seen in Siberia when thousands of reindeer were infected. Not only does the permafrost melting bring about possible plagues but if it were all to melt our atmosphere would be flooded by extreme amounts of carbon dioxide that have been buried for centuries. With all the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere it could be likely that Wallace Wells's predictions would become possible. Such as extreme droughts where much of our agriculture is taking place or even wars over increasing heat. The future is scary to think about currently but if as a whole our human race doesn't take action, these scary predictions will start happening sooner than expected. 
     <br><br>
With so many studies and plain evidence right in front of our faces I don't understand how there could still be climate deniers out there. I know that many fossil fuel companies have their hand in that but with even the slightest possibility that the climate isn't as endangered as many people claim, I would still be terrified that humans have caused such a drastic change in such a short period of time.

In this daunting piece about the climate crisis, David Wallace-Wells paints a picture of the future of the planet and the human species as we navigate the effects of climate change. Wallace-Wells makes some very important, valid points throughout this article. I especially like the paragraph where he talks about the reasons why we are unable to comprehend the real-world effects of climate change (e.g. technocratic fetishism, climate denialism, uncertainty about uncertainty, imcomprehensible scale, etc). I think this is extremely important to recognize and think about because it can help us attempt to make the climate crisis more comprehensible to the general public. As Rob Nixon suggests in his work regarding "Slow Violence," humans are not conditioned to perceive threats that extend across temporal and spatial scales; rather, we associate threats with immediacy, excitement, and discreteness. People don't perceive climate change as a threat because they are unable to link it to something specific and tangible.

     <br><br>

The introductory section was interesting and presented fairly well...then the rest of the article gets a bit carried away. All of the topics he talks about are important, and many of his claims are surely valid. However, he presents much of the information in a way that's too matter-of-fact, when he himself recognizes the uncertainty of the effects. After pointing out that the effects of climate change will depend on the amount of warming we experience in the coming decades, he goes on to talk about what will happen to the planet at varying degrees of climate-scenarios without clearly establishing them. As a reader, it just comes off as too "certain" in a clearly uncertain situation. Also, it's hard to tell what are the best possible situations vs what are the worst-case scenarios. 

     <br><br>

In general, this piece is downright discouraging. As a bit of a pessimist myself, I realize that it is important to lay out the severity of the matter and not to sidestep the likely disastrous future that will result from even the best possible situation of climate change. However, there is a way to present this information without making it seem like all hope is lost. Because if it is...then what's the point?

From the first sentence, the article, “The Uninhabitable Earth,” portrays a darker and much more severe reality of climate change than I’ve ever encountered. Although I have always personally believed in the harsh consequences of climate change/warming, I did not exactly consider these consequences greatly affecting people of this lifetime. As I’m sure many people can agree, the way I saw the effects of global warming becoming very visible and prominent would be way into the future. I clearly was not educated on this subject in the slightest. Although this article seems grim, through explanation of scientific evidence like describing the effects that melting permafrost has on carbon emissions, the article enlightened me to the harsh truths of our planet’s soon arriving possible demise. To answer Professor Hiltner’s question from the video, however, I do think that while Wallace-Wells is being realistic about impending doom, he is taking such an approach to sharing this information that may incapacitate readers with fear. 
     <br><br>
As terrible as it was to be brought of my ignorance on the subject, I think that reading this article was a perfect way to quickly educate those like myself who do not know much about climate change and to effectively kick off the class. I had no idea the horrific effect that a simple two degree celsius increase could make in our world. Heat death, in particular, frightened me as I had no idea that the human population would not survive the heat alone as a threat. As I read further into this article, the more hopeless I began to feel about our current situation on Earth. Climate change seems to affect every aspect of life on Earth whether it be environmental or otherwise, and that absolutely terrifies me as it should everyone else. Every topic discussed from the carbon emissions to the economic disasters caused by climate change made me feel that “the prospect of our own annihilation” is actually inevitable and is coming sooner than most think.

I would agree with your statement that the article created a realization that the effects of global warming will not only affect us in the future, but rather are already affecting us now, with worsening consequences on the horizon. For example, Wallace-Wells speaks of the ramifications of climate plaque, when he tells of a boy being killed, and 20 others infected, when anthrax was released from retreating permafrost. Before reading this article, I was unaware that scenarios such as this were already happening, and therefore I was surprised and a bit stunned at the immanency of these major threats. 
     <br><br>


Where I disagree with you is regarding your assertion that the article was the “perfect way to quickly educate those… who do not know much about climate change.” Though the article may have provided very accurate information that could be useful to more knowledgeable readers, I believe that the alarmist nature of it would only serve to paralyze uneducated readers with feelings of our impending doom. This would therefore discourage action against climate change, rather than helping to support action as the author likely intends. I think that for readers who may know very little or nothing at all about the impending affects of climate change, an article that gives slightly more hope would serve to better transition them into a state of action.

I tend to agree with the alarmist stance on climate change and the climate crisis. While I do see how bombarding people with dire projections and stats has the potential to create apathy, I do not think there is any alternative. If presenting citizens and leaders with cold, hard, scientific truths doesn't motivate change or action, I don't know what will. Personally, after reading the article I felt a sense a mix of hopelessness and motivation. Hopelessness for the future of the planet, but motivation and reaffirmation that I want to pursue a career that helps the environment, even if it is in a small way. With climate change there tends to be an "out of sight, out of mind" effect, in which people tend to dismiss climate disasters that aren't directly impacting them. Unfortunately, I think it may take a massive event such as the drowning of a small island nation to motivate the general public and governments to take real action. In terms of the climate-related disasters that Wallace Wells laid out, I found food shortages to be the most compelling, mostly because I found it to be the most plausible. The fact that grains are the staple of the global diet and can only grow in certain climates means that a food supply collapse would certainly be possible with a rise in global temperatures. I found Wallace Wells's point about lack of fertile soil in northern climates to be interesting, as some would just say we could grow grain in the northern areas once the planet warms. Food shortage could in turn lead to conflict and political strife. This sounds quite dystopian, but I do think it is entirely possible. I do not think the future is all doom and gloom, however. As professor Hiltner alluded to in class, this decade will be massive in deciding the future of climate change. Young people have been given an earth that is tainted and we have the ability to make change through lifestyle choices, technology, and by voting in elected officials that prioritize climate issues. Through this, we may be able to avoid an uninhabitable earth.

In the article titled “The Uninhabitable Earth”, David Wallace-Wells warns about the ramifications that may occur if we fail to take action in regards to the climate crisis. The tone of the article is confrontational and brutal; in fact, many argue that the author is too alarmist. Initially, I was concerned when he explicitly stated that the readers are not alarmed enough. However, I disagree with the idea that he is too alarmist and feel that we have passed the point in time where articles on climate change should be dismissed because they are labeled as “too alarmist”. People need to hear the whole, bitter truth about the climate crisis since we are coming dangerously close to passing the point of no return. I thought the most compelling consequence of climate change that David Wallace-Wells discussed was the end of food. This section was particularly concerning because over eight hundred million people suffer from malnutrition today. This number is expected to increase dramatically as the population continues to grow and as climate change decreased agricultural production. Moreover, the crops that are produced will contain less nutrients since high carbon dioxide levels affect the nutrient density of crops and will decrease the global availability of nutrients by 19.5% for protein, 14.4% for iron, and 14.6% for zinc according to a 2019 research study titled "Combining the Effects of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide on Protein, Iron, and Zinc Availability and Projected Climate Change on Global Diets". 

     <br><br>

At the end of the article, I felt prompted to act. At the same time, I felt overwhelmed by the solutions he called for (such as invent new technologies to extract twice as much carbon from the atmosphere then we currently extract) and felt unsure what specific actions I could take. I think it would be useful for him to outline specific, feasible actions that people could take to combat the climate crisis. I appreciate how he ended the article on an optimistic note and stated that if humans created climate change, they can also combat climate change.

I did not expect to feel the way I do now after reading this article. The presentation of the statistics and the elaboration on what that truly means for my generation was beyond shocking. I felt blindsided with the information that was presented since I believed that I knew an adequate amount about the pressing issue of climate change. In addition, since all this information was presented on the basis that humans do act on the issue, I am extremely fearful for the future. Elon Musk’s idea to colonize Mars as a plausible reality did not register with me before. According to Wallace- Wells, there is no plausible program of emissions reductions alone that can prevent climate disaster. This fact to me shows a big problem within our culture since the lack of education among the common person leads to focusing on the wrong goal to attempt to prevent climate change. There are much more effective methods that are not on the forefront of the public’s mind which would create more positive change.  The severity of the effects of heat death on all mammals is something that I believe many people don’t necessarily think of directly when questioned about climate change. The seriousness of heat death and the threat it poses should not be ignored. Heat death is already a major problem in the sugarcane region of El Salvador since the dehydration led to one fifth of the population having chronic kidney disease. The threat that the food production industry poses to climate change is alarming. I was planning on having a hamburger for lunch but after reading this article I can’t eat one. This contributing factor to climate change from the article had the largest effect on me since I will be making active changes in my diet in efforts to eat more sustainably. Nonetheless, the idea of climate plagues affecting me and my generation are still terrifying. Most of these outcomes don't seem like a reality including the unbreathable air. The fact that human cognitive ability will decline by twenty one percent due to the air and humans will have a shorter life span by ten years and people still aren't making climate change a main focus of theirs is mind blowing. I understand the politics behind the industry but the long term effect of economic collapse and perpetual war override the current situation.

Reading the article written by Wallace Wells, I do somehow see some characteristics of being an alarmist from what Wells has written. But other than saying I would describe Wells being a harsh alarmist or giving a pessimistic sense which some people might say about Wells when he talks about how our future would be like if we don’t take action now quickly. I would describe what he has annotated in the article are definitely important to alarm people or in other words, to educate and lead us to see the bigger image how the world might become with some of those alarming scenario can happen. Instead of telling us firmly what will happen in the future, Wells provided us with some past historical facts/events and leads to to think about the future world that will encounters with some of the alarming scenarios. I would say what he has mentioned in the article might seem so strict and direct to some people, but it is undeniable, at least for me, that what he is saying is true and is something we all should be concerned about. For quite a few times, Wells mentioned in the article that tells us the facts that not a lot of people are actually brave enough to face and to realize the actual degree of seriousness of the climate problems, people are not alarmed enough no matter how well-informed they are. He reminded us continually of how the climate has been changing overtime and the impacts had already brought to earth is quite the alarmist nature that can be seen from him.
     <br><br>
I personally was quite surprised when I read the part about the climate plaque and I got scared because I didn’t know that diseases can be trapped and released for permafrost after so many years and what is even more scary is the with the rise in temperature, the disease can reevolve. I do see that can be a very serious problem if it is going to happen in the future again.
     <br><br>
After reading the article, I would say even what we are doing in daily lives might only be a small action that each individual action doesn’t bring huge change to climate problem. No matter whether Wells is too alarmist or he is completely correct, the climate problem is actually for real here that faces all of us. We should wait for too late for a change and it doesn’t hurt that everyone one of us do something to help save the earth we are living.

After reading the article I felt Wallace-Wells' call for action towards climate change was too alarmist and he drove possible readers away who may not have been as open to the idea of climate change. Wallace-Wells I felt was only looking through an extremist lens at all the circumstances which while effective to use as a realization for readers of actual possibilities it also wasn't effective because it drives readers away from taking action because he only points out the most extreme possibilities. However, I do agree with Wallace-Wells you can't downplay the issues at hand or else you risk it getting put on a secondary priority and escalating but I still feel Wallace-Wells pushed a somewhat Domesday idea. 
     <br><br>

Besides feeling Wallace-Wells was too alarmist I thought the article was very interesting and addressed possible consequences that I wasn' t aware were an effect of climate change. One of the more interesting ones I hadn't learned about was the effect temperature rise has on all crop productivity and the outcomes this would have the equatorial region. This was surprising to me because I know that area grows a lot of specialty crops and normal crops so for that region to possibly become unfertile is alarming. While I don't fully agree with how strong of a stance Wallace-Wells took I did agree some large steps need to be taken soon or we may be in the alarming situations Wallace-Wells predicts.

I agree with your statement that Wallace-Wells' comes off as very alarmist however I don't think this drives readers away as his alarmist style of writing in the article helps serves his purpose in showing the most drastic consequences of climate change. Especially if the reader understands the purpose behind his tone because if the reader realizes that he is portraying a worst-case scenario they realize that even the less severe effects of the climate crisis pose massive issues for the current and next generation. The idea that people would essentially give up because they think the world is coming to an end is not a common opinion shared by many as people tend to fall in two camps of believing in climate change and making steps towards changing it, or not believing in it and subsequently not taking steps to make a change. However those who believe in climate change but think we should do nothing about it because it is so late, would seem to be a very small part of the population. 

     <br><br>

One of the most interesting ideas proposed in this article for me was the idea that perhaps there have been other civilizations on other planets but before they can get technologically sufficient enough to traverse the star they burn out due to the corruption of their planet. However we only have what is currently happening to Earth to test such a theory but this idea would explain why we have never seen any extraterrestrial life. I also think the inclusion of this idea by Wallace Wells' is an attempt to encourage readers to not make earth another statistic like the other planets theorized about.

After reading this article, I have a new understanding of global warming and climate change. Wallace wells' article actually sounds a little alarmist, causing some people to panic. But it also makes readers realize the seriousness of the matter, indicating that if we do not take action on climate change, these may become reality. Before reading this article, my view on global warming is that the higher the carbon dioxide emissions, the higher the temperature, the Arctic ice began to melt. This eventually led to a rise in sea level. I didn't realize what harm the melting of the Arctic permafrost would do to the earth. Now it seems that the climate warming caused by human activities is just the beginning, and the real harm is the methane or carbon dioxide released by the melting of the Arctic permafrost. If people don't take it seriously, it will be a disaster. This article uses our fear of the future to tell us the seriousness of the situation so that we can change our thinking at the beginning. Finally, I am very happy to have a more comprehensive understanding of global warming through this article.

<p>
The article by Wallace-Wells sure does take an alarmist and pessimistic approach to our views on global warming, but taken into context that this article was written in 2017, it is understandable that many view it as alarming. 3 years ago, there were not as many environmental related events that had an enormous global impact as 2019 and 2020. But if we were to look at the article now, it is possible so say that Wells was not being pessimistic after all, from the Amazon Rainforest fires of 2019 to the current Australian fires of 2020, it is certain that our world is slowly becoming inhabitable. 
     <br><br>

Wells’ schedule of humanity’s “end” occurred normal to me. As a person from China, I have experienced a few years of smog, and from living in Venezuela for almost seven years, I have personally felt certain changes in the surrounding temperature. His description of the Unbeatable Air and Heat Death all seemed plausible. But instead of being as worried as some of the scientists Wells interviewed in his article, I am still at the stage where “Ignorance is Bliss”, I have this blind hope that the world will get back on track and break through this Great Filter. Thus, I would like to learn more, and ultimately do more to contribute to the development of mankind instead of preparing for an apocalypse.  
     <br><br>

From a current perspective, even if we do not want to accept Global Warming, we are forced to. People like Greta Thunberg stepped out into the public at the right time, with perfect supporting evidences such as the forest fires and other natural disasters as her argument. It is not a time to debate whether global warming is a myth or fact, but rather a time where everyone is forced into action. I believe that people with minds like Greta Thunberg would slowly but surly step out into the eyes of the public. It is only a matter of time before a few of Wells’ predictions emerge.

I definitely understand how you come with that understanding of seeing Wells is an alarmist and scaring people off sometimes while we read it. But you are right, looking at what has actually happened now and especially the recent environmental disasters/events, he is actually right somehow and that means we all should really taking concerns about the situation of the planet earth and time to deal with the climate problem. So I won't say Wells is too alarmist as he is simply annotating the past events and coming up with ideas of the future world we will be living. I don't see any points that he is simply making something up to make the climate problem condition looks serious.  I was also very interested in hearing you sharing you experience of personally went through some of the alarmist scenario that Wells have also mentioned in the article. I believe we all wish the earth can get back to a health stage or at least not to get worse any more even though it can be quite hard to achieve, but I have hope that it is still possible if all of us are willing to take an action on it seriously.

I can see why people would label David Wallace-Wells as an alarmist, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say that he is scaring people into inaction or that his article is working against his goal. Because he outlines every worst case scenario that he thought of, it can be overwhelming, but that doesn’t mean we should turn a blind eye to these issues. If it comes down to being scared or being oblivious, knowing the different possibilities has to win. How would any measures be taken if people weren’t even aware? 
     <br><br>

The way Wells describes the sequence of events shows the vicious cycle of global warming patterns. I found this interesting because it’s a positive feedback loop where warming leads to even more warming, and so on. For example, permafrost melted in the North Pole due to global warming and released carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide evaporates as methane, which has a warming power much stronger than carbon dioxide. This kind of thing explains why the earth’s climate has warmed at such an alarming rate. We continue to realize these consequences after they’ve happened, and many scientists’ observations don’t convey enough urgency. Although the rapid warming that we’ve already set in motion doesn’t show signs of stopping, all we can do is try to prevent further damage.

The article presented by Wallace-Wells highlights many of the horrors associated with the increase of global CO2 concentrations. As the most populated areas of the world are condensed in search of habitable living conditions; diseases that have been eradicated for hundreds if not thousands of years will reappear and wreak havoc on the defenseless human body.  As the sea-levels rise and food growth slows will the people of earth begin to revert back to primitive beings with the sole purpose of staying alive by any means possible. The effects of rising temperatures can already be seen in the world's hottest countries as civil-war tears civilizations apart in the madness that ensues famine. 

     <br><br>

This being said; after reading the article and watching the videos the importance of pursuing science to counteract the effects of CO2 will be the greatest challenge within the next decade. Whether the solution comes in the form of increasing the human body's ability to survive higher temperatures and vaccinating against resurfaced disease; or developing a way to cleanse our atmosphere of carbon, a solution will be found. 

     <br><br>

As mentioned by Wells; the lack of contact with any other form of life not based on earth may prove that the life span of advanced civilizations in the long run maybe be shorter than simplistic forms of life due to the destruction of their environment.  If humans manage to colonize mars will our technology ever rise to the ability of intergalactic travel or will the end of our race slowly approach as our technology and utilization of natural resources hits a wall in advancement?

Reading comment: Wells does a great job of appealing to endangerment.  This does not discredit the article as being just a fear mongering viewership piece.  He uses evidence that makes sense to the audience and that they can relate to. For example bringing up California wildfires and how it has been above average for heat over the last five years.  The alarmist nature does come out when he discusses the loss of food, wars, unbreathable air.  This stance and way of drawing support deterred me from becoming a supporter.  I didn't see a clear cause for all the examples provided and it felt as if he wanted to blindly support because i haven't a clue how he got to those conclusions.  I concluded my reading of the article alerted, overwhelmed, and confused.

    <span>
Loss of food:     <br><br>

The main cause is desertification. Desertification is the process by which fertile land becomes desert, typically as a result of drought, deforestation, or inappropriate agriculture. While increasing population (another issue discussed) causes the latter two, the initial cause is strongly linked to climate change. As stated by the climate reality project in 2016, "While droughts can have different causes depending on the area of the world and other natural factors, the majority of scientists have started to link more intense droughts to climate change. That’s because as more greenhouse gas emissions are released into the air, causing air temperatures to increase, more moisture evaporates from land and lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water. Warmer temperatures also increase evaporation in plant soils, which affects plant life and can reduce rainfall even more" This means the amount of land where you can plant crops is severely diminished, thus reducing the global food supply. If you want some empirical examples there are plenty of areas that are already feeling these effects. 

     <br><br>

Wars:     <br><br>

I found this area a bit tricky to wrap my head around but hopefully, I can try to explain the cause and effect relationship here as well. I don't completely see the link between irritability and increased conflict, however, there are many contemporary conflicts that were caused (directly or indirectly) by climate change. Let's refer back to my previous explanation about food scarcity and its relationship to climate change. If food and water are harder to come by (on account of more frequent and severe droughts) then it follows that countries that are experiencing these hardships will need to find a way to obtain these essential resources. If importing mass amounts of water and food is not feasible for a country's economy (often the case in Africa and areas of the middle east) then invading a nearby country becomes an increasingly attractive option. Think about it like oil. Oil is an (increasingly) scarce commodity as well as a relatively necessary one. Because of its scarcity, countries (like the US) have resorted to violence in order to obtain it. Now if water and food become a similarly scarce commodity it makes sense that in the future we will be seeing conflicts started over those resources as well. If you want a real-life example of "water wars" look to the conflict between India and Pakistan where water as been "Weaponized", or to the massive civil unrest caused by lack of water in Mexico.

     <br><br>

Unbreathable air:     <br><br>

Even though you can't see them, microscopic particles of carcinogenic matter are floating all around us. It is usually in such small dosages that it hardly has any effect on us. However, those who live near refineries or factories are at a monumentally larger risk of lung cancer and other medical complications. In those areas, the concentration of cancer-inducing particles is so high that the number of people getting lung cancer is exponentially higher near those refineries. In a 2017 meta-analysis (meaning this study was basically an analysis of all of the other studies published on the topic) by Lin, C., Hung, H., Christiani, D.C. in the environmental health journal found that "Lung cancer, as the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, has been linked to environmental factors, such as air pollution."

An alarmist is one who needlessly exaggerates danger and so causing needless worry or panic. For this reason, I would caution anyone from calling Wells an alarmist and would encourage them to read the first couple of paragraphs of the annotated version of the article. In the annotated version, rather than jumping directly into the "doomsday" scenario, Well's prefaces it with a few sentences about why he chose to write the article the way he did. Included in this preface, Wells grapples with the issue of alarmism and whether it is helpful in journalism. Those opening paragraphs are crucial because they provide a lens with which to look at the article. Rather than a "most likely scenario" the article bravely addresses the issues that many people are afraid to confront and shows that they may be more probable than you once thought. The article is absolutely crucial because the media is oversaturated with topics like "sea-level rise". The oversaturation has a numbing effect on the reader and makes them care less about the issue at hand. The constant bombardment of articles regarding "sea-level rise" and other less graphic events is partially due to "scientific reticence". Well's refers to an interview with James Hansen that more clearly explains the issue of scientific reticence, "You’re rewarded in science for not stepping out too rapidly," In other words, Scientists often feel an obligation to make sure their published work is both non-controversial and highly probable. Well's attempts to represent the other side of the spectrum. The side of the spectrum, that, although not "unlikely" per se, is more jarring. Absent articles such as this, it would be incredibly easy to look to the news and assume that the worst of climate change is "rising sea levels" and "higher temperatures", but the value of articles of this nature is that they create a call to action that is not as present in the news today.

I totally agree with what you're saying here. Many neoliberals make the argument that this problem will fix itself with new and better technologies, pointing to previous predictions of doomsday scenarios made in the past. However, they (along with many major news organizations) are oblivious, purposely or otherwise, of the overwhelming scientific consensus concerning climate change. A major fault of many journalists concerning this issue is their insistence on making everything a debate, to enlarge and platform the arguments of a tiny minority and treating them with the same seriousness as a reasonable position. The result is reporting on climate change that centers on maybe one or two effects of climate change and "debating" on if it's happening or not. Therefore, when there are two extremes (climate change is a crisis or not at all), they naturally shift to the middle, but they neglect the fact that in issues like this, taking a centrist position will achieve nothing. 

     <br><br>

Just as you said, this singular focus on one effect of climate change waters down the significance and scope of the issue. This is the beauty of Well's article: he lists out not one, but nine extremely dangerous implications of climate change, from direct heat death in the tropics to mass extinction. By attacking the issue from so many angles,  the reader realizes that no matter how privileged or safe they feel, climate change will soon effect them and everyone they know irreversibly. Even in California, a paradise in comparison to many other places on Earth, there are numerous dangers. The desert will become completely inhospitable, the air quality will become dangerous to even go outside, and wildfires will be more destructive than ever. Fires on the scale of the Thomas Fire will become commonplace, and even seeing the aftermath of the much smaller Cave Fire recently gave me chills. 
     <br><br>


Therefore, Well's 'alarmism' is the solution, not the problem. The spread of great journalism such as this which challenges people's beliefs and the status quo, instead of preserving it like most journalism is trying to do now, is an important step to our survival as a species. While he admits in a later article from December 2019 that it won't be as bad as he previously thought, it doesn't downplay the long-standing, irreversible changes that have already occurred.
<br><hr>
I didn’t read the annotated version, so what you point out is insightful. Although the article without annotations makes strong claims, I’m sure Wallace-Well’s preface makes the content more digestible and possibly believable to skeptics. I agree with your comment on sea-level rise and oversaturation and I think that’s important to note for those already aware of climate change, but only think about helping in terms of using metal straws and composting. The oversaturation of superficial climate content is like you said, numbing and doesn’t scare people into action as much as Wallace-Well’s article. Because people are emotional beings, we have to be personally affected by a situation to truly care about its consequences, therefore, scientific jargon related to environmental consciousness won’t resonate strongly with people. Because of this, I understand why Wallace-Wells portrayed his argument in this way so that readers can imagine their own lives being negatively affected by climate change.
<br><hr>
I really appreciate this comment for your dedication to the further research into the annotated version. It helped me understand better the purpose of the so-called alarmist perspective that Wells wrote with. I found that in the original article, I was pulled in by his first statement about how whatever the reader thought they knew about climate change, it was worse. I found that encapsulating because of the strength of that claim. That goes along with what you, Evan, are saying about how timid the scientific community is about drawing apocalyptic conclusions like Wells lays out. On the other hand, I would say that this caution is for good reason. Take for example the drastic claim that Wakefield made when he claimed that vaccines cause Autism. It has long been disproven and redacted but that fast claim led to an entire, misled, anti-vax culture. The way I see it, because of cases like these where scientists have been fast to come to drastic apocalyptic claims, it’s understandable for scientists to be cautious even if the evidence is all there. I don’t necessarily feel that in this case, the caution is wise, but I do understand that it can be explained.

<br><hr>
As others have pointed out, the point you made about the oversaturation of one impact of the climate crisis that isn’t as jarring as others being the numbing effect was very enlightening. Before reading Wallace-Well’s article, I have always grappled in my head about what is the best way to communicate the dire need to change “business as usual” in order to combat the climate crisis. For our generation who will be taking the brunt of these consequences, I think it’s important and quite effective for environmental journalists to be as brutally honest as possible and to avoid this scientific reticence because we are too far beyond the point of comfort. By dividing the article into multiple impacts of this future scenario he presents, Wallace-Wells veers away from the style of mainstream media and introduces impacts that we don’t typically think of. For example, the correlation between climate change and wars helps the reader materialize the climate crisis as an issue tangibly impacts their lives. Furthermore, the correlation between climate change and economic decline/collapse negates the accepted belief that trying to fix the climate crisis would be too costly for the world. 
     <br><br>

I think an interesting point that Wallace-Wells brings up is the “Great Filter” and how industrial civilizations are naturally meant to rise and die within several hundreds of years. However, in his collection of interviews with scientists, they are optimistic that we will be able to engineer ourselves out of the problem that we created. This insinuates that humans are a special species that can defy the odds that have been seen in the history of the “Great Filter”. While climate scientists may believe this, it is quite difficult to imagine the entire world making a collective effort to combat the climate crisis. Even though this article is effective in allowing the reader the internalize and own these issues, it fails to engage those who have circumstances in their personal lives that don’t allow them to care about the climate crisis. For those who are of lower socioeconomic class, it is difficult to feel like one has enough agency when the issue at hand is so alarming. For this reason, and for the fact that Wallace-Wells doesn’t present his argument about the solutions for this crisis, this article has still left me a bit jaded and numb; this article forces me to put my faith in the hands of scientists, world leaders, etc. and not the everyday person like myself to engineer solutions to the climate crisis.

Wells' argument, though stated as alarming and pessimistic at times, is extremely needed in a society in which climate change is severely repressed. Wells introduces interesting points about the emergence of ancient diseases that are incompatible with our immune systems and can affect the lives of many if the ice keeps melting. However, these points may seem direct and harsh, they still remain true and concerning. Wells' article may seem alarming and intimidating, but his argument still reigns true, and readers should feel compelled to take action rather than giving up as this is a sign of an unmotivated human race. 
     <br><br>

Moreover, my personal opinions regarding this article was that Wells presents his claims in a harsh but not attacking tone. He poses extremely dire and important points, but in a way that is more professional and logical. At least to me, I read the text as well as listened to the audio that was posted at the end of the article and the way that Wells phrased his sentences and approached every claim was more sequential and logical rather than attacking and harsh. However, I can see how people may perceive his argument as alarmist as his facts and points are extremely worrisome and severe, but the nature of these facts should not affect the way people take away the information. These facts are harsh and concerning because the world is in such a bad place that these statistics are true, but they should not inhibit the reader from taking action, no matter how alarming and concerning they are.

One aspect of the climate crisis that I never thought about was what the article called “heat death.” I always hear about the impact of melting glaciers and the effects of global warming on wildlife; however, I forgot about the potential direct impact of global warming on people. It’s a scary thought that the warming of the earth could be a direct cause of peoples’ deaths, especially in tropical areas where the humidity is high. It’s common for people to think about global warming indirectly causing deaths by the means of natural disasters, but the thought of people dying by direct heat is terrifying.
     <br><br>

This article really did a great job of outlining multiple harsh effects of global warming. Wallace-Wells focused on the worst, most extreme consequences, which demonstrated his effective use of pathos. For me, reading about these climate change effects made me extremely scared for the future. Although people view Wallace-Wells as an alarmist, the consequences that he laid out will hopefully motivate people to make a change in order to veer away from where our world is heading.

A dreary inhospitable wasteland, that is the future of the Earth’s habitat according to David Wallace Wells in his article “The Inhabitable Earth”. His views on climate change, founded by countless documents and studies, can come across as the voice of an alarmist. While many of the threats to humanity which Wells hints towards may never come, without actions being taken towards the reduction and restoration of our carbon footprint, there will inevitably be disastrous outcomes. By any means, the possible warming scenarios pushed forward by organizations such as the UNIPCC are conservative estimates at best. Ranges concerning the change in temperature span an increase of 4 degrease. And with the release of trapped methane gas within the world’s ice, the likelihood of air that we and many other species will be unable to withstand. Critics of Wells’ views on climate change argue that his alarmist agenda may be a detriment to the movement. Wells’ distrust of technological innovation as a means to reduce the overall climate is disheartening and nihilistic. One phrase that stood out to me as alarmist was “no matter how well informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough”. After reading through the article, I couldn’t help but find myself lost in a seemingly not so distant future, that of poisonous gas, economic crisis, and rising sea levels. The picture he paints is still shockingly optimistic though, Wells holds onto the sentiment that as people see the damages climate change is bringing upon this world, they will be urged to reconsider and strive for a cleaner more sustainable future. While I don’t agree with everything Wells writes in “The Inhabitable Earth”, I do agree that the easiest change we as a people can make is a change in lifestyle.

After reading this article and the facts presented, the question I have is how are there still people in our world that don't believe in global warming and climate change. Wells' approach of scaring the reader into taking action is a strategy that could work but could also backfire. When he says things like it being too late and having to think about other places to live, it is scary but in fact the truth. Some of the smartest people in the world have expressed their concerns with the growing carbon emissions into the atmosphere and what is means for the Earth going forward. 

     <br><br>

The most intriguing part for me was the fifth section talking about "Unbreathable Air." To me this is the most interesting because it touches on the problem of wild fires and how the changing temperature can make them even worse than they already are. From what is happening in Australia right now, to the fires in Santa Barbara in the past few years, and the fires that occur at home for me in San Diego, I relate to what he is writing. The scary thing for me personally is that Wells says that it is going to get worse. I've seen the effects that it has had on people in Santa Barbara and now the devastating effect it is having in Australia.
     <br><br>


The numbers that Ken spoke about at the end of the video are facts and not something that can be debated as true or not. Things like hurricanes and wildfires and temperature rise are direct result of not taking care of our planet. It is crazy to think that in 80 years the city of Miami may be underwater.

This article raises the question of how people seem to look past the effects of global warmings but I believe this is due to the greater problems humans face in daily life. The problem is rooted in basic capitalism, and the fact of the matter is that investing in the environment will not return a profit seen in your bank account. Although it is needed for the sake of humanity, the simplicity of looking past the problem at hand is far easier than addressing one of the biggest issues we will face in our lifetime

David Wallace-Wells does in fact instill a fear factor in his article. After completing this reading I was in awe of all the non-direct and direct effects of climate change. I think the article did a good job addressing impacts like perpetual war, and the end of food, which are related to many societies. I can see how some people critique Wallace-Well's stance because it is a bit extreme and alarmist. However, data does show the serious effects like how earth has been the hottest ever in the past five years. So while the impacts of climate change might be alarming, they are very important to consider when scientists can completely prove the warming of the earth.

David Wallace-Wells paints a frightening picture that shows the future of our planet if action is not taken to reverse humanity’s harmful behavior to the earth. Although very apocalyptic, I appreciate Wallace-Wells’ work, as it portrays the potential devastation of our current behavior and the necessity to change the narrative of the future we are heading towards. 
     <br><br>
I think that Wallace-Wells’ alarmism is powerful as it is very thorough and scientifically sound, but many scenarios he draws up almost sound unrealistic because of how extreme they are. Personally, after putting down the article, I feel further moved to help the planet slow and reverse the global warming process, but I did not find it extremely moving as it paints such a dystopian future that I do not believe humans will allow this world to reach. 
     <br><br>
I find heat death to be one of the most interesting, and grotesque “scenarios” of the article, as Wallace-Wells states that “at 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half the world’s population, as distributed today, would die of direct heat.” The large-scale devastation of this scenario, combined with the odious nature of death – human bodies “cooked to death from both inside and out” – projects a horrific future that must be avoided. 
     <br><br>
Overall, I am thankful to have read this article, as it has expanded my knowledge of potential catastrophes climate change may bring - more than just sea levels rising. Wallace-Wells’ article is not only a warning, but a call to action fro us as humans to change our ways and change our future.

Yes, Wallace Wells was a bit on the alarmist side of things but he certainty woke me, a reader up from the damage that the people such as myself are constantly doing to the earth. He gives us a scary yet believable future of what the earth holds because of all the facts he’s used making it even scarier because it’s the truth. We constantly put up awareness for Climate Change but are any of us really doing anything ?? I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t one of those people. This though has certainly woke up my slumber of the earth being fine and nothing will happen while I exist on this planet. 
      <br><br>
  Climate change is increasingly at an incredibly fast rate according to Wallace and that means most of us to be adults or those who might be adults already are responsible to do something even though it really was never out fault but are dealing with consequences of years ago.

<p>
After reading this article I can see why some people would deem David Wallace Wells an alarmist. His approach, it seems, is to scare his readers into action. I think the severity of this piece is necessary. The facts are extremely alarming. Halfway through this article I just stared at my wall and thought, how are we ever going to solve such a hopeless problem. But then I realized that we must not lose hope. Because if we do not even try to take the necessary steps to solve this problem- however daunting they may be- then we are idly subjecting ourselves to our own ruination, as well as the planet’s and all it’s life. Therefore we must do something, and we must do it urgently. 
      <br><br>

While the term alarmist usually paints a negative light, I believe that alarmists are necessary and the more of them the merrier. People need to begin to understand and see climate change as a HUGE life threatening issue, and these alarmists are the people that are passionate and are willing to go to great lengths to educate people. In order for people to see a need for change, they must be frightened and alarmed enough to want to take action. However, I think that with this alarm, there must also be people who inspire and bring hope. Bringing only alarm to people might have negative effects and cause people to become either too frightened to act or act in selfish ways. However, if one presents solutions and remains hopeful, then people will want to change their habits because they know it will make a difference. 
      <br><br>

I believe that climate change will only be able to be solved once the majority of the population understands this issue and cares enough about the future of the planet to act. Loud and passionate people are effective at spreading knowledge, and that is what we need today. 
      <br><br>

The part of the article that scared me the most was the fact that with the goal we are striving to reach, the 2 degree temperature rise, we would still experience major environmental disaster resulting in staggering numbers of deaths. This means that no matter what human history decides to do, there will still be consequences. People need to realize this and understand that we stand a chance of surviving if we act hard and act fast. 
      <br><br>

To me each consequence was a compelling enough reason to invoke a desire for change, but what really stood out to me was the discussion of new/old diseases that would arise from permafrost melt. History remembers things such as the Bubonic Plague and small pox for a reason. These diseases kill millions of people, and no one is safe. Another huge pandemic could be so disastrous, and the fact that human immune systems would not be able to fight it scares the crap out of me. 
      <br><br>

Another huge eye opener for me was the fact that climate change will lead to huge food shortages. Already, so many people are starving and even in the US many people suffer from malnutrition because they do not have access to healthy foods. Imagine the pain that will arise due to the growing population and the dwindling availability of food.

I think you make a very rational argument about Wells trying to "frighten" his audience into action. Of course upon hearing of all these dire consequences, the sinking of Miami and Bangladesh, the permafrost and the diseases awaiting to be unleashed, how difficult the challenge itself is to address - all these can frighten any reader, and for some people, this may be enough to "jolt" them into some kind of action or shift their perspective about how they need to become active performers in the race to save our planet.
      <br><br>

BUT, On the other hand, I think Wells is employing the style he is as much - or even more so as a writing tool to make a statement, rather than just a pure means to scare the reader. He is trying to draw a contrast between how bad the problem is, and how little action and thought is being put into it. He is trying to say that in relation to how bad the problem is, not nearly enough effort and action is being put into it. This can be felt towards the end of his article, where his tone subsides and he tries to instil in us his final message. This is not really a message of fear. It's a message of inquisitiveness, of question, and reason. "But when we do truly see the world we've made, they say, we will also find a way to make it liveable". This is basically saying, we still haven't been jolted into action, as if we're waiting for the world as we know it to be destroyed for us to really address the issue. The question that pains him the most is not the consequences themselves, but our disproportionate response to them, we simply aren't doing anywhere near enough.
      <br><br>

The "desperate" tone of the article may sound to some readers as preaching, or as an attempt to "scare" them, but I find the tone very much erroneous. The stark contrast between how big the problem is, and how small our attempts to solve it are thus far, is very accurately and vividly painted by his tone throughout the article. That I think, is the biggest success of the article.
      <br><br>

<br><hr>
I largely agree with your stance on David Wallace Wells alarmist nature. I believe at this point in time fear may be one of our greatest motivators to fix this daunting issue. As global citizens, we must be fully aware of the detrimental consequences heading our way if we do not take action.  Although David Wallace Wells’ content within his article is very grim, I truly believe, as you noted, that this piece is necessary to bring action and begin to resolve this problem. 
      <br><br>

Your idea that we must also seek information and articles that bring hope and optimism really stood out to me as well. I did not personally view this article as too grim and alarming, but many people may have had a different response. I believe optimism is another great strategy to motivate change, because it allows people to realize their actions are making a notable difference. Without small acts of change from individuals around the globe, working to dampen the effects of climate change will not be possible.

Although some regard Wallace as an "alarmist" and criticize his harsh, panicked approach to the climate crisis, I believe that, at this stage in the fight against climate change, panic may be one of our most essential yet underrated tools. Many before Wallace have tried using graphs and legitimate scientific data and even empathy as ways to show the world (and world leaders) that climate change is something to be handled with utmost seriousness. Unfortunately, no amount of diagrams or pictures of sad baby animals or posters of starving children has fueled any drastic changes on the parts of many world leaders and politicians towards a greener future. And so, since logic and empathy have failed, Wallace (and other climate activists such as Greta Thunberg) has decided that maybe fear is the best way to get people to realize the severity of the situation. 
      <br><br>

Personally, simply reading ONE of the nine examples of what could potentially happen if we don't take the issue of climate change seriously and do something about it was enough to get me all fired up and freaked out. Even the titles themselves could be names for upcoming horror movies; Heat Death: Coming to a theater near you way sooner than you'd expect. All jokes aside, Wallace's approach to climate change carries out its intended effect because it's so extreme and because the issues he's presenting (war, disease, famine, widespread death) all sound like they're straight out of an apocalyptic horror film. They sound unbelievable, fictitious even, but that's what drives the reader to change their ways and to want to make a difference, because no one wants to live on an uninhabitable (or even unwelcoming) earth. 
      <br><br>

All nine examples presented by Wallace in his article were interesting and shocking to me in their own ways, however, the one I found to be the most interesting and the most shocking was Part VI: Perpetual War. I had always kind of thought of climate change as solely and environmental issue, and then I took English 22 and realized it was so much more than that. Climate change affects and will affect almost every aspect of our lives, whether it be social, economic, agricultural, etc.. The one thing I had yet to consider before reading this article was that climate change could actually start wars. Once Wallace explained how extremely limited resources could increase conflicts almost two-fold, I'll admit I felt a little dumb for not realizing this sooner as Wallace suggests that this phenomenon may have already begun not too long ago. Another aspect of this section of the article that was fascinating to me was that the U.S. military is apparently obsessed with climate change. This got me thinking, could the threat of climate caused wars be what pushes the U.S government to wake up and re-join the other 187 countries that have signed the Paris agreement? Or will certain political leaders ignore the warning signs (and warnings from their own military) and idly sit by as impending worldwide doom approaches? Only time may tell.

Although this is marked as an alarmist article, it educated me more than frightened me. As someone who cares about the climate crisis, I have become accustomed to seeing information presented through a pessimistic tone. However, this article seemed to hold a hopeful ending which gives rise to solutions, although never explicitly stated in the article. I feel that now given this new information, I can work more effectively to counteract these possible outcomes for it is much easier to solve a problem when you actually know what you’re dealing with. I believe that by describing in detail the possible consequences to our inaction is actually a practical way to encourage people to action. 
      <br><br>
One of the huge issues with people today is that they are simply not educated enough about what the climate crisis truly entails. Most believe that the Earth will simply become hotter but fail to realize that tornadoes, floods, and other natural disasters will also follow. Not only that, but disease and famine will spread rampantly throughout the world. Ancient plagues once trapped within the ice will be released and other viruses previously only found in the tropical area will move north. Additionally, there will be a decrease in breathable air and the oceans will become so acidic that they are sure to kill more than just fish. Most are ignorant of all of these possible disasters which leads them to believe that the issue at hand is far less important than it actually is. But by thoroughly explaining these dangers, people can come to realize the true gravity of the situation even if it frightens them. If people aren’t worried then how will they be passionate enough to save the Earth? People, in a sense, need to be shaken to their very core to invoke that need for survival.  
      <br><br>
Out of all the potential outcomes, I think the cherry on top is war. Not only will wars add to the death count, but it simply is a natural result of the devastation the climate crisis will wreak. Wars are always fought as a desire to obtain something whether that be power or land, and in this case what is left of the world. With scarce food and arable land, it's clear that only those in possession of it would survive so there is sure to be a fight over who will lay claim to them. In a dying world, people will be in a constant state of fear and desperation so tensions will rise and economies will fall if the climate crisis hasn’t already caused them to. The wars may even be what actually leads to global devastation by speeding up its destruction. The emissions released by these wars can very well be the final straw.

Reading Comment- The article starts with a great summary and clarification of the real consequences of climate change. The author clears up any incorrect pre-conceived notions the reader may have had. For me, I was clarified over the variety of impacts a changing climate could have. Part II, (Heat Death), did a great job of highlighting how the change in climate could result in direct casualties via heat. It brings the question of what would happen in the case of extreme heat rise. The poorest areas do not have air conditioning, nor the ability to migrate to a cooler climate. How would this additional problem be addressed by the nations. Nations such as Iraq and India would struggle with a large lower class and poor infrastructure. I was also very surprised to see how people in El Salvador are already experiencing the effects of climate change. Part III was also interesting as it referred to the dust bowl, which I just learned about in a class this past quarter. I was shocked to hear about how diseases can be reintroduced due to the climate crisis, and even further alarmed by how it has already occurred via anthrax. Seems out of a sci-fi horror film. In the 3rd section it brushed over a rise in wildfires, which has especially affected UCSB and residents in Southern California. In my lifetime I have personally seen and been affected by the rise in amount and severity of wildfires. As far as solutions posed by the article, I have already read about carbon capture technology, but am skeptical of whether it is realistic. At the end of the article, I found the “Great Filter” concept extremely interesting to think about. Maybe it's true, but id be surprised one civilization never figured out how to be sustainable for the everlasting future. This article was very good and covered all the ways and aspects in which the climate crisis will affect humans. Through reading this article I gained a better understanding of the consequences of all of our actions.

      <br><br>

Initially I thought the main dangers of the climate crisis was just a rise in sea level and increasing temperature. Although these are important results, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Though both the article and the lecture, I was able to deepen my understanding on the impacts of the climate crisis. I know how about the impacts of results such as heat death, end of food,  plagues, air, and war. These are all vastly important effects of the change in the environment around us. I am glad I know have a more complete understanding of the possible climate crisis effects.

While David Wallace-Wells may sound panicked in his article "The Uninhabitable Earth", proclaiming to readers what essentially sounds like "this is the end," it is unfair and potentially dangerous to classify him as "alarmist", as it is yet another method to undermine his credible argument with the idea that he is merely trying to get a rise from his readers. By calling his article alarmist, it implies that he is simply using shock value to capture his audience, while in fact he is putting forth a well researched article on how severe the climate crisis really is. it is yet another way the severity of the issue is lost on the public, since his predictions are scary, and it is easier to deal with them by pretending that our situation isn't as dire as he makes it seem. While reading the article, I didn't feel fearful, but rather distanced from the issue. It is much easier for the human mind to not process what this global temperature increase means for our kind, than to fully realize what our potential future could hold.
      <br><br>

 To answer your question, I found the topic of perpetual warfare resulting from temperature increase most compelling. I found it really interesting that researchers were able to find a connection between temperature and crime/conflict, as I perceive these to be very independent from each other. I would be interested to know how it's possible to prove such a correlation, or if it is rather just researchers hypothesizing over data that slightly supports this idea.

<p>
After reading this article, a newfound sense of awareness was instilled within me. It is scary to think that cities and humans could be consumed by rising bodies of water, or such an immense amount of carbon is being released into the air at an alarming rate. Like Wallace-Wells implies, the magnitude of this temperature change and increase of carbon dioxide in the air is dangerous and life threatening, and lessen the chance of human life being maintained. Not to be pessimistic or fatalistic, but throughout the article I felt like I was reading a manual on how to create mass extinction.
      <br><br>

Reading on how methane released in the Arctic was the cause behind one of the five mass extinctions really put into perspective the severity of the climate crisis. Its relation to the fact that 40.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide was pumped into the air in 2019 is insane. The video above states how a mere 1.5 degree increase can have a massive impact on the earth, so the fact that the earth is heading towards over 2 degrees is extremely frightening. This reading being full of what-if questions allowed me to really consider how increase in temperature is harming several aspects of life, whether it be health, economics, etc. I realized that the climate crisis is more than the average greenhouse gas image, and there are countless consequences that come with it. For instance, I never took into consideration how melting permafrost exposes deadly disease/remnants from a century ago. 
      <br><br>

Wallace-Wells’ laters refers the earth as an “angry beast”; I now see how humans constantly feed the “beast” with more and more carbon as humans continue to use fossil fuels in their daily lives. As consumers, we have default tendencies that ultimately fuel the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the air. This comes from air transportation, factories that produce everyday goods, etc. Furthermore, one of the main consequences of climate change that really struck me was the lack of food that would remain. Temperature increase will result in severe droughts that will lead to no rich soil for crops to grow, no crops for animals to eat, and no animals for humans to consume.

I was shocked by the same facts as well: the exposure of century-old diseases wiping out a part of the population is terrifying. A poisonous ocean without fish is hard to imagine, as most of these scenarios are. Wallace-Wells' alarmist approach is precisely what the public needs to understand. He revealed a chilling truth from the first paragraphs, explaining that the climate crisis is much worse than we've assumed. Many of us have been desensitized by hearing the common scenarios of sea level rise, hotter temperatures, and extreme weather patterns because it's difficult to picture, and for some reason we think that we will not see the worst of it. What took me by surprise was the estimated time that these disasters will be taking effect. By 2050 we will have to decrease our carbon emissions by half each decade if we want to meet the limit of the Paris Agreement, but not even that will be enough to save us. 

<br><Br>
The article evokes a sense of urgency by scaring us immediately. The news sugar coats it, people don't want to imagine it because it makes us feel defeated or helpless. We're enacting the bystander effect by thinking that our small changes will not make a difference. As Professor Hiltner said, we can make a big difference now by switching to a plant-based diet and the use of birth control. With these scientific estimates, we know that what lies ahead is terrifying, but these events will only take place if we don't take action.
<br><hr>

 I agree that it is odd that many humans fail to comprehend the worst of what is to come. This relates to how individuals of today (especially in the United States) do not take into consideration what is happening to the climate due to profit from fossil fuels, and the thought that this circumstance will not affect them during their time on this planet. Like you said, this article really enforces the disastrous circumstances of climate change without action, and it does all start with humans bringing it to themselves to make proper changes in their living styles.

If people are dying from liver damage due to hydration wouldn’t that decrease the population in that heated area, thus reducing the carbon emissions? I know this is a morbid thought but if we were to quit administering care to those suffering from dehydration would that act as a low scale population control? Is modern medicine ethical? We are keeping people alive despite their poor conditions and they continue to contribute to the carbon issue. This is scary stuff to be thinking about.
<br><br>
I feel this hitting hard at home. I come from the Central Valley CA where the world agricultural center is. Our county prides itself in being the producers of a large part of the world’s food. However, our farmers have been struggling due to the long lasting drought in our area. I knew about the droughts before I came to college but I had no idea the severity of droughts in other areas as well. The agricultural capital of the world cannot function without adequate amounts of water. People will be out of jobs too which would create economic chaos in my area. Another thing that hit right at home with me while I was reading is the smog that plagues our atmosphere. Smog in the valley is visible when you come over the mountains. It looks like the valley is a bowl with grey soupy smog floating above it. Because of this many people in the Central Valley have asthma. Will respiratory diseases continue to rise as the climate crisis becomes more imminent?

Regarding the initial question regarding population control, I have a few thoughts.
      <br><br>
1. At best this is a short term solution. Without increased administration of birth control or the increased education of women, it would only be a matter of time until we arrive at an unreasonably high population. Even if those at the equator or those in the southern hemisphere were to die out, the astonishing rate at which babies are being born (namely in India, China, and the US) in the northern hemisphere is unsustainable in and of itself and we certainly do not have enough time to wait around until the number of people in these developed countries drops to a safe level on their own.
      <br><br>
2. It would disproportionately harm the poor. Wealthy people can afford water even if the scarcity causes the price to increase to $20 per bottle of water, while the poorer people would be unable to afford it. Furthermore, the very wealthy will be able to flee areas that are experiencing severe droughts while the poor would be much less likely to. Overall, while the population would decrease, the people who'd die first would certainly be the poorest and most vulnerable. Not only is this unethical to let poor people die, but it would also have an insignificant effect on our Co2 emissions. As Ken mentioned in the lecture, the poorest 3 billion people contribute 5% of our global Co2 emissions.
      <br><br>
3. Although this thought experiment may be helpful in terms of making sure we exhaust every option available, I think this philosophy inherently relies on the notion that we cannot control the population with birth control and other currently available methods. 
      <br><br>
In regards to the ethics of modern medicine and its administration to those living in poor conditions, I would simply say that as long as they are living, breathing, humans they have the same right to be alive as we do. Western countries do not forcefully inject these people with vaccines, rather, they give them the option to take the vaccine or not. Even though it is easy to look at these people's lives and say they "aren't worth living", the more developed nations have a duty to give these people the option to choose to live regardless of whether or not it seems like it thinks it is in their best interest.

After reading both the article, "The Uninhabitable Earth" by David Wallace-Wells and watching your video regarding the content I was shocked to hear that a majority of the world is not fearful of what is to come in regards of the climate. I personally understand that having fear makes a situation a lot more surreal especially when it comes to the destruction of our earth so others not understanding the inevitable future is a crazy thought to me. I was shocked to hear that human existence has caused the celsius level to rise 1%, I can only imagine how much we can contribute as humanity evolves and population grows! Is one of the more influential contributions to climate change the emission of fossil fuels?

Before reading this article I had little knowledge on Arctic permafrost and was unaware of the drastic consequences that could face the Earth if they were to defrost. After reading this article I now believe that the permafrost should be one of the world's main priorities as the carbon levels would skyrocket to toxic levels. The carbon gas released can multiply its warming levels to an extreme amount causing potential dangers to the earth and its ability to sustain life. The fact that the date for this emission keeps moving forward is scarily alarming to me that the world needs to take better care of its habitat.

I'm replying to your comment because I agree with you that the melting of the permafrost in the arctic is one of if not the most pressing issue facing the climate change problem today.  I had never heard (or at least fully understood) what the melting of arctic permafrost meant or the severity of what it could cause.  Reading "The Uninhabitable Earth" however has frankly shocked and disturbed me with its description of what could happen should we allow climate change to hit that critical point and release all the once frozen carbon into the air.  The fact that the stored frozen gasses could be released as methane, something 34 times more powerful than what we are already poisoning our atmosphere with, is terrifying when considering the scope of just how much could be released if we do not act now.  It truly seems like a doomsday switch that when hit will be impossible to recover from. I think it is something that absolutely needs to be talked about more when discussing the issues of climate change, as like you said its melting could drastically multiply global warming levels.  In my opinion there should be much more media attention and focus on this, as I think that it is a hard boundary that we cannot cross and people will be more likely to pay attention to it.  As said in the article, "when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination," yet I think if more focus is given to this issue it could become a point to rally behind.  There are many possible disasters that could result from climate change, so many that people may zone out entirely from the issue as it is just too much to think about.  But with a clear and precise danger of the permafrost melting being known and cared about by more people, hopefully we can better organize and find a way out in time.

Although intense and extreme, Wells’ argument holds much data-backed and cautioning truth that serves to warn of and illustrate a dire future that is quite possible if the climate change problem is not greatly and swiftly fixed. Therefore, it does not seem as though Wells directly fits an alarmist role, as he supplies factual statistics and evidence to corroborate his ideas and prove their real future possibility, and thus is not exaggerating to cause unnecessary panic. This tactic of presenting true facts to support a seemingly far-fetched idea is meant to spark action, as the author hopes that, by presenting the realisticness and genuine likelihood of such extreme events happening due to climate change, readers will be scared into taking up an impactful role in the race against world destruction. Personally, after reading this article, I did not feel alienated from the issues and the necessity to remedy such, truly feeling more inspired to encourage up and coming solutions and to take a stand amongst my peers to support main leaders in this climate fight.

While all nine ideas in their own ways were intriguing and shocking, even, the concept of the “Great Filter” was most interesting to me. Prior to reading the article, I had not wondered why such paramount happenings such as the ones discussed, ones that are likely to destroy the world in which we live today if are not ceased, have not been hot topics in the media until recent times. This notion allowed me to begin a reflection on modern society’s values, along with my own.

I agree with your opinion. Among the nine subtopics in Wallace-Wells’ article, I am also attracted most by “The Great Filter” concept. According to Peter Ward, great filter indicates that civilizations rise, but there’s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly. This idea vividly makes sense to me. As human beings, the development of industrial technologies brings civilization to us, while the result of this civilization includes much more pollution and ignorance of the exploited natural resources. Since the coincidence of civilization and huge climate change, we are heading toward the environmental filter which could erase our earth and our lives.

    The great filter concept is also a good approach to combine and summarize for the possible terrible results of climate change, such as heat death, unbreathable air, and poisoned oceans. All of these possibilities constitute the powerful and dire environmental filter. Therefore, I feel strongly motivated by the reading to make changes and take actions for the climate. Wallace-Wells utilized both rigorous statistics and vivid scenarios to make the readers confront the climate change without evasion.

I thought that the reading, The Uninhabitable Earth, was successful at communicating its subject as it gave multiple examples of the harsh realities of the possible outcomes due to climate change. Although it was a dark look at the future, I do not think that this was alienating people or calling certain groups of people out because as a whole the inhabitants on the Earth need to come together and make a change to help keep a healthy and habitable Earth for the next generations. From the article the topic that really stood out to me as interesting was the climate plagues, because I think that many people do not realize that trapped in the ice are diseases that have not resurfaced in years for examples diseases such as the flu, smallpox, and bubonic plague. The increase of temperature not only melts the ice caps but could release a disease that our immune systems are not able to protect against creating a super virus that could have devastating effects on the planet’s population. Reading the article I had mixed feelings of fear and a call to action as I want to do my part to help keep the environment live able. I think that this articles audience was aimed at all youth and middle aged adults, especially those in America who are the start and middle of generations because this group of people has the most effect on the environment and are actions directly affect the future.
      <br><br>

I think the most compelling thought from the article is that we need to help take away the great filter that has many citizens thinking that our actions have no negative effect on the environment and that we do not need to worry about the future of the earth. I think as a society we all need to come to an agreement on ways to lower carbon emissions and help keep sea levels from rising, these can act as starting points for the discussion on how to help prolong the life of the Earth. I think this is an article that is very interesting and thought provoking so I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
